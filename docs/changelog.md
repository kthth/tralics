ChangeLog for the Tralics software
==================================

Work in progress
----------------

### Bookkeeping with no functional change

-   Lots of refactoring of the C++ code using `clang-tidy` and
    `clang-format`, making use of some C++17 features (too many changes
    to list, many of them automated)
-   Merging of the various documentation files, reorganization of the
    directory structure to make it more readable
-   Transition to CMake, and automatic run of the tests as part of the
    build
-   Remove a few unused function parameters and some dead code

### Changes affecting the output

-   \[2020-02-12\] import a
    [patch](https://github.com/softcover/tralics/commit/5164df1cdf978da0e8eb28d38b6e8fd2baf8f47b)
    from the SoftCover fork which includes missing refs in links for
    reference (only changes the output if there is an error)
-   \[2020-04-21\] switch to `spdlog` for logging, this changes the
    format and the repartition of the contents, hopefully in a
    reasonable direction
-   \[2020-08-14\] do not insert an empty attribute pair in
    Parser::T_start_theorem, this changes the output slightly but is
    cleaner

2015-11-25, Version 2.15.4
--------------------------

-   \[2016-01-04\] Bug correction in environment `subequation`
-   \[2017-05-26\] Added command `\omitcite`

2015-08-06, Version 2.15.3
--------------------------

-   Corrected error message in `\newcounter` overflow.

--------------------------

-   **\[2007-05-02, version 2.10\]** Added options leftquote and
    rightquote. Indicate how to translate character left and right quote
    in non-verbatim text mode. Feature: if option usequotes is selected,
    doubles quotes give \<\< or \>\> in French language. Feature: Double
    left quote, and double right quote translated into " and " (U+201D,
    U+201C). \[2007-05-04\] Feature: First token of a math expression
    removed if it is `\relax`. \[2007-05-17\] Feature: More characters
    allowed in math mode. Changed translation of `\upsilon` and

    commands in the output of `\showthe`, `\showtokens`. \[2007-06-01\]
    `\protected` commands no longer considered as `\outer`. Corrected
    implementation of `\marks`. Made `\mathbbm` an alias to `\mathbm`.
    In math mode `\\char`&[ produces ]{.title-ref}[&amp;]{.title-ref}[
    (and not ]{.title-ref}[&]{.title-ref}\`).
-   **\[2007-07-06, version 2.10.1\]** Feature: *Tralics* counts the

    `\UR{Sophia, Rocquencourt}`. (Raweb) Added `\ResearchCentreList` as
    alias to `\UR`. (Raweb) Semantic change: Optional argument
    \`Location\' added between \`Lastname\' and before \`Catpro\' in
    `\pers` in `catperso`. Mandatory for multi-located teams. (Raweb)
    New Location arg can have a default value. (Raweb) Feature: File
    apics2007.ult not loaded when compiling the ra. (Raweb) Feature:
    When *Tralics* generates a tex file for the RA (option -ps), it uses
    latin1 as encoding. (Raweb) Feature: Team and section titles printed
    using terminal encoding. Bug fix: Tralics should works again for RA
    2005 (bibliography).

-   **\[2006-11-14, version 2.9.1\]** Bug fix: It is possible to insert
    underscore in file names defined by `\InputIfFileExists` (T.
    Bouche). Bug fix: confusion between masterthesis and mastersthesis
    in `make_names` (T. Bouche). Bug fix: Switch \'IUCLC\' removed in
    function `set_termio`, because it does not work on Mac and testing
    whether we are on a mac is non-trivial. (Pb signaled by David
    Pichardie).
-   **\[2006-11-28, version 2.9.2\]** Feature: OS type is printed on the
    log file, works correctly on macintel (N. Roussel).
-   **\[2006-12-10, version 2.9.3\]** (txbib) Bug fix: second argument
    of `make_new_entry` was ignored (Theo Papadopoulo). Feature: In the
    raweb case, apics_all2006.bib is read (if it exists) instead of
    apics2006.bib, apics_refer2006.bib, apics_foot2006.bib. Bug fix:
    Additional fields are also copied in crossref. Feature `foot_prefix`
    is now useless in biblio. \[2007-01-04\] (txclasses) Bug fix, babel
    options were empty. \[2007-01-14\] Bug fix: Spaces normalized in
    `\index`. \[2007-01-17\] Bug fix: Underscore chars allowed in team
    name (Laurent Pierron). \[2007-01-29\] Added math commands
    `\triangleq\Cap\Cup`. Changed `\allowbreak`. Added `\m@th`.
    \[2007-02-11\] Added Configuration mfenced_separator_val=\"foo\"
    Added option -(no)math_variant. You can say: tralics -param foo bar.
    Feature: There are 15 math fonts, corresponding to the 13 MathML
    variants. (plus normal and upright). In nomathml mode, they are
    hacked. Change: the name in a `math` is a C++ string instead of
    char\*; it holds the first argument of a `\mathbox`. Added
    `\mathci \mathcn \mathcsymbol`. Change: you can say
    `\mathmi[foo][bar]{gee}`, translates to `<mi foo='bar'>gee</foo>`.
    Feature: Parses `\\char`\$[ the same as
    ]{.title-ref}[chardef]{.title-ref}[ in math mode. Feature: A single
    ]{.title-ref}[\<mn\>]{.title-ref}[ element is created for a sequence
    of digits \[2007-02-16\] Feature: Space character allowed in an
    environment name. Feature: Font size commands allowed in
    ]{.title-ref}[\$xmbox{small\$y\$}z\$]{.title-ref}[. Bug fix: char
    U+0327 is not special in math mode, since it\'s not ASCII. Use
    ]{.title-ref}[times]{.title-ref}[. Feature: Translation of
    ]{.title-ref}[right.]{.title-ref}[ is empty delimiter unless
    -compatibility mode. Bug fix of ]{.title-ref}[letA B
    \$A\$]{.title-ref}[ dumps no core any more. Math mode change:
    ]{.title-ref}[vskip]{.title-ref}[ converted into
    ]{.title-ref}[vspace]{.title-ref}[, although this is useless.
    Change: No space in translation of ]{.title-ref}[A \[2mm\]
    B]{.title-ref}[. Bug fix. In math mode
    ]{.title-ref}[end{foo}]{.title-ref}\` inserts a closing brace only
    if the begin inserted an opening brace (i.e., not if the begin was
    created outside math mode). Bug signaled by Thierry Bouche.
-   \[2007-02-18, version 2.9.4\] Improved the test when opening a file.
    Option bad_minus added Bug fix: In the case `$1^23$` the superscript
    is 2 (T. Bouche). Bug fix in `math_p::find_paren2`; a group is big
    if it contains a big element. Gives better placement of `<mrow>`.
    Added `\mathfontproperty`. Added `\colon` as
    `<mo lspace='0'>:</mo>`. Changed `\def\root#1\of{\@root}`. Corrected
    translation of `\widehat` (invalid character code). Added
    `\operatornamewithlimits`. Added `\qopname`. Added: you can say
    `$\left/ !\right\backslash$`. Changed implementation of
    `\mathop...\limits`. Bug fix: Translation of `$\big(xy$` was empty.
    Bug fix: Translation of `$\big(x\big\}$` has mfenced, because `\{\}`
    converted to `\lbrace\rbrace`. Bug fix: less-than and greater-than
    behave like `\langle, \rangle`. Feature: Exchanged execution order
    of cv3 and cv4; this gives big delimiters in
    `$\bigl(\sum \bigr )^2$`. Bug fix: Math style computation corrected:
    Exercise 17.15 gives correct answer. Bug fix: Boolean `\ifinner`
    gives correct answer in math mode. Bug fix: Command `\pmod` produces
    inserts 18mu or 8mu of space depending on the mode (display or not).
    Bug fix: Translation of `\iff` the same as `\Leftrightarrow`.
    Changed translation of `$\rm x\bf 2$`. Added `\@Vert`, that is the
    same character as `\parallel`, using this as delimiter. All
    delimiters work now. Change: `\overbrace\underbrace` produce a large
    operator that can have limits. Fixed translation of `$\mathmo{<=}$`.
    Added `\phantom`. Change: Automatic position of mrows: not in case
    open big close, but in case Big open close. Added:
    `\ImaginaryI,\ExponentialE,\DifferentialD, \InvisibleTimes,     \ApplyFunction,\InvisibleComma`.
    Added `\cellattribute\rowattribute`. Bug fix: Multline environment:
    all equations are in display style, first and last are correctly
    handled. Added `\tag` and variants. Added environment `gather`;
    commands `\xleftarrow \xrightarrow` optional argument added. Added
    `\lvert \lVert \rvert \Rvert \cfrac \accentset     \undertilde \overleftrightarrow \underleftrightarrow   \arrowvert \bracevert \Arrowvert`;
    and a lot of other commands also. Bug fix: Xmatrix was wrong for
    X=b, B or V!. Implemented commutative diagrams. Added `\scanupdown`;
    needed for `\sideset`. Feature: phi and varphi swapped. Bug fix:
    Width of normal space in math mode changed from 6pt to 4pt. Changed
    definition of prime character. Changed definition of `\asymp` , is
    now asympeq, U+224D. Allow font changes in text in math. Allow
    commands like `\hfill` for horizontal placement of fractions or
    arrays. Phantom and smash hard-coded. Sideset command hard-coded.
-   \[2007/04/28\] `\relax` commands retained in the math tree.
    Mathfonts are groups now. Added option nozerowidthelt. Commands
    `\begingroup \endgroup` allowed in math mode and used for font
    switch.

2006-08-01, Version 2.8.x
-------------------------

-   **\[2006-08-01, version 2.8\]** Change in readline: `killbuf` is a
    string, `history` a vector of string Static functions are now in a
    namespace.
-   \[2006-08-06, version 2.8.1\] Moved interpretation of config data in
    `tralics.C`. Added a file `txaccent.C` that handles all accents.
    Change: expansion of `\a'` is `\'`. Change: use `\tracingmacros`,
    for showing expansion of accents. Change double accent
    implementation. You can say `\a'{\a^e}`; error messages could be
    Error in accent, command = \\\'\^, Cannot put this accent on letter
    i. Change: If interactive, read config only if given as parameter.
    Changed again the algo for finding config file. Default value can be
    set in the Makefile. Otherwise in a new file `txpath.h`. Changed the
    file mktar. Now the tar contains a directory.
-   **\[2006-08-08, version 2.8.2\]** Change. You can say `$\S$`, not
    `$\textsection$` (both are valid in future versions). Changed
    expansion of `\o\ae\aa\th\dh`, and uppercase version, to characters.
    They are allowed in math mode. Added `\caps \hl \st \so \ul`. Use
    same method as `\textsuperscript`. Commands like `\ier` do not
    produce an entity anymore. Rather than, they are like
    `\textsuperscript{er}\xspace`. Added commands
    `\list, \endlist, \usecounter`.
-   **\[2006-08-09, version 2.8.3\]** Added `\@item`, like `\item`, but
    replaces label by an attribute. Changed at-sign char to be letter
    while reading config file. Config file allows `\let\item\@item`. Bug
    fix for `\xmlelt{}{-}`. Added concept of xx.clt, xx.plt, xx.ult.
    Added an optional star after `\input, \include, \InputIfFileExists`.
    Changed `\usepackage{foo,bar}` to be the same as `\usepackage{foo}`

    macros. Bug fix: Inserted missing `flush_buffer` in `cst2_cmd`, like
    `\ieme`.
-   **\[2006-08-15, version 2.8.4\]** Change: Transcript file says date=
    2006/01/02 03:04:05. Implemented `filecontents` environment. Bug fix
    `\InputIfFileExists` has three args. Feature: file foo.ult loaded
    only if document class exists. Added new file `txclass.C`. Bug fix
    `\newenvironment{foo}[2]{}{#1}` now invalid. Feature: All calls to
    `file_exists` are traced. Name change: `Buffer, att_list`: renamed
    `add` to `push_back`; `buf  << bf_reset` is the same as
    `buf.reset()`. Feature: Star after `\chapter` etc is handled.
    Default star in book, outside main matter Added `\toplevelsection`.
    You can say: tralics apics2006 -config=../confdir/ra.tcf (bug
    signaled by M.P. Durollet) Added count register `\notrivialmath`.
    implemented index mechanism. Bug fix: Array preamble accepts rlc of
    category other. Bug fix: Verbatim numbering OK now. Bug fix: Array
    preamble accepts a char declared ShortVerb. Option -nostraightquotes
    added. Bug fix: Implicit `\noindent` after `\item[]`. Feature:
    Attlist number 3, 4, 5 reserved for index, TOC, biblio. Added
    `\thanks` as an alias to `\footnote`.
-   **\[2006-09-04, version 2.8.5\]** Change: command `\textasciicircum`
    produces char U+2303. Change: Option -notrivial-math is the default,
    option trivial-math added. Bug fix: Tables in a tabular OK now.

    instead of none. Added `\anchor` Bug fix: Command `\@arabic` ok.
    Feature: Section titles in the transcript file. Bug fix: Leaders are
    OK now.
-   **\[2006-09-09, version 2.8.6\]** Feature: Three values possible for
    the second argument of `read_a_file`. Feature: Main file not
    immediately converted, but later. Change: All files are converted
    into UFT8 internal. Change: The number 256 appears in a single
    include file. Change: The number 257 replaced by `special_relax`.
    Change: The number 255 appears no more in a C file. Changed retval
    of `cmd_chr::char_val` to integer from character. Use `relax_code`
    instead of `subtypes(256)`. Changed `Str_hash` realloc step size to
    10000 instead of 1000. Replaced constant 100 by `xml_offset` in
    `txmath.C`. Change: `^^^^abcd` does not put the character back in
    the buffer, but in `unread_char`, saved by `push_input_stack`. Hash
    table size increased plus info in case of abort. Feature: argument
    of `\newif` must start with if. Replaced calls to `hash_find` by
    `locate`. Changed retval of `get_a_new_line` to a vector of
    characters, instead of a buffer. This is saved by
    `push_input_stack`. Feature: Value of `\endlinechar` can be zero.
    Feature: Compilation date now in XML file. Feature: Meaning of
    `log_or_tty` changed. Hack: Version number changed to 2.9 for the

    Removed `\cite@type` ; is now in natbib.plt; `\cite@@type` added as
    hook. Bibtex scanner: `author="\{\"x"` is interpreted as a Latex
    string with three tokens. Result is always balanced. bibliography:
    `all_entries` is a vector of pointers. Makes life easier. Removed
    interactive_bib option. Changed four hat parsing again. Input buffer
    is converted to Unicode characters in a vector. More calls to
    `scan_left_brace_and_bi`, which has been redefined. Feature: Option
    confdir=foo is OK as 3 shell tokens. Change: Use of == in tpa
    assignments Feature: img file not created if no images exists. Bug
    fix: second `\ignorespaces` added in `\item`. Bug fix: `\index`, @
    can be letter or other. Feature: all symbols of latexsym are now
    implemented. Added `\wlog`. Bug fix: Relax scanning: `\frac{foo}\x`
    is ok, if `\x` is a user defined command. Added `\pageref`. Change:
    `candimen` replaces 18mu by 10pt. Removed `\zerospace`. Changed
    `\enspace`. Buf fix: Print \# not \#\# in case of error in

-   \[2006-09-09, version unchanged\] Implemented some e-TeX extensions;
    Change tracing for `\tracingassigns`. Reimplemented `conditions` as
    vector. Changed current font to `tenrm`.

2006-04-01, Version 2.7
-----------------------

-   \[**2006-04-02, version 2.7**\] Bibtex modifications. There is a
    field that contains the current year as an integer. 0 means missing,
    -1 means unparsable. If 2 chars given, then 06 is replaced by 2006,
    96 by 1996. An error is signaled in a refer; if the year is 0, -1,
    cur-year, greater than cur-year; the entry is moved into the year
    section. Some braces are removed when sorting. Change: Finding
    profile on mac changed.
-   \[**2006-06-12, version 2.7a**\] Fixed `\unskip`. Added `\mathfrak`.
    Added `\@addml`. Added `\operatorname \DeclareMathOperator`.
-   \[**2006-06-14, version 2.7b**\] Changed `\keywords` to undefined by
    default. It is too dangerous to use the environment as a command.
    Added `\choose \shoveleft \shoveright`. Added environments
    `multline aligned`. Added `\@firstoftwo` and `\@secondoftwo` (in
    LaTeX syntax), `\@ifbempty` `\@iftempty` (in C++).
-   \[**2006-06-14, version 2.7p4**\] Trying to print characters in
    `no_mode` is no more a fatal error; the mode is changed to
    `argument_mode`. Bug fix: if foo is empty, `\input{foo}`, *Tralics*
    crashes. Bug in push/pop input stack fixed; `cur_input_stack` is now
    a vector. Double pop avoided by checking the length. Name of
    file/virtual file added. If you say -noentnames, there are no more
    entity names, math mode also. Otherwise, generate
    `&straightepsilon;` and `&varepsilon;` instead of `&#x3F5;` and
    `&#x3B5;`. Easy part of bootstrap code is now written in C++.
    Reevaluate uses `lines.split_string`, comments are ok now.
-   \[**2006-07-05, version 2.7p6, 2006-07-14, last patch for v2.7**\]
    Added lots of functions in file `txcommands.C`, so that each case in
    the big switch has less the 5 lines. Changed Raweb structure:
    removed some tests in `txcheck.C`. Added `\@setmode`. Changed
    production of keywords in the hyperref.cfg file. Changed the
    semantics of the `\pers` command. Changed biblio for the raweb.
    (raweb) Config file: ra is no more the first type. Clean up. (raweb)
    New argument for *Tralics* distinguish_refer_in_rabib Concept of tcf
    file added; all config files converted to tcf Changed directory
    structure of *Tralics*. UTF8 output is possible now. Removed all
    8bit characters in configurations files. Removed all 8bit characters
    in the C++ sources. Added ra.tcf, tralics_rc has now a single type.
    Cleanup in `txcommands.C`. A big table is used instead of a function
    for `cst1_cmd`. `\guillemotlet` and `\guillemotright` produce a
    single character in this table.
-   \[**2006-07-23**\] Following files added:
    `txio.C   tximage.h, txscaled.h, txid.h, txeqtb.h, txfp.h, txio.h, txstats.h,    txpost.h, txcond.h, txatt.h, txhash.h, txxml.h, txtokenlist.h, txarray.h`
    `tralics.h` contains no class definitions any more. Removed one
    global variable in `txarray`. `att_list` is essentially a vector.
    Simplified logic of `T_par1`. Converted `line_ptr` in a list.
    Renamed Language as att_language in config file. \[raweb\] Removed
    default for theme_vals, affiliation_vals, profession_vals,
    section_vals, ur_vals. Fatal error if missing. (raweb) Function
    `sans_titre` hacked. Option -hacknotitle added. rahandler: uses
    tralicsdir instead of rawebdir. Everything that was in the the old
    rawebdir now copied in the Tralics dir. Option
    distinguish_refer_in_rabib is true by default. (raweb) Implemented
    `\refercite` for the two latex classes. Removed `temp_list` data
    structure. Re-implemented `token_list` as a normal list.
    Re-implemented math lists also. Added classes `math_f` and `math_q`;
    removed three calls to \'abort\'. Added two files `txmath1.C` and
    `txmath1.h`. Use `#xab;` notation for math chars. Added function
    `buffer::add_int16ent`. Added function `buffer::real_utf8`. The only
    function that produces chars. Bug fix: Translation of `$\hbox{é<}$`
    is now OK. Bug fix: in nomathml mode, `$\hbox{$x$}$` is ok. Added
    `end_all_input_code` command code. Now `\end{document}` is the real
    end. Fixed tralics foo -confdir=../confdir. No delay for the
    `\addattributestodocument` for DocAttrib.

-----------------------

-   \[**2005-08-09, version 2.6**\]
-   \[**2005-09-05, version 2.6pl1**\] Wrong topics. Bug fix: Transcript
    file truncated in case `\mathchardef\Xc=3` (signaled by Sebastian
    Öblom).
-   \[**version 2.6pl2**\] Bug fix: `\cline` did not work correctly,
    because a carriage return was added between cells, and it was
    expected that only cells appear in a row.
-   \[**version 2.6pl3**\] Bug fix: math_type of `\models` was wrong

    confusion between `np_line_thickness` and `np_linethickness`. Added
    `\XMLaddatt`. Bug Fix. In math mode, `\hspace{...}` did not work
    with newline as space because `the_toks()` uses category code 12.

    `Verbatim`. Added `\unhbox` etc.
-   \[**2004-03-16**\] Bug correction in `scan_int_digs` : In the case
    of `\box{123}` only one error is signaled. Added `\showlists`. Bug
    fix: `\showthe` and `\showbox` print to transcript and tty. Added a
    name to every buffer (for debug). Reduced the default size of a
    buffer to 128. Added `\OR\AND\NOT\isundefined` in if-then-else.
    Removed one of the splitter buffers. Added `\newtoks`.

2003-09, Version 1.9
--------------------

-   \[**Version 1.9b** date unknown\] New includes
    `txparser.h txtoken.h txfonts.h txlogger.h`. `#include<stdio.h>` is
    now in `tralics.h`. `lex_type` in now unused. `old_catcodes` moved
    into `Parser`. `verbatim_chars` moved into `Parser`. `token_to_list`
    is now useless. `Token::val` is private. `Token::Token(int)` is now
    explicit. Added a new option that avoids year errors in the
    bibliography. Add a new class `log_or_tty`. If the option -verbose
    is not used, then (not done) is not printed. `\show\foo` gives:
    \\foo=macro: \#1bar -\>x{} (à la TeX without \\n). `\show` upgraded.
    `\show` prints also in the log file. Correction of: There was no
    image image. No `<biblio/>` if biblio is empty. The name of the
    `.bib` file is in the `_bbl`. Better error message in the case of
    `\a{}` and `\a{toto}`. `\meaning` works as in TeX. Correction of a
    bug in `\SaveVerb \UseVerb`.
-   \[**Version 1.9c**, date unknown\]
    `\font\foo=cmr10 at 30pt \show\foo` works. Don\'t start in RA mode
    if standard or no `\documentclass`. Corrected a bug in `see_tex_ext`
    (forgotten `finish_string`). String stats: the sum of
    `String+string` is printed. *Tralics* stops after 1000 errors.
    Removed `Main::initialised`. Replacement of `bauteurs` and
    `bediteur` by `bauthors` and `beditors`. If I do `\bibitem`, I do
    not add it to the rest. Some functions in `txbib.h` are private.
    `version_string` moved to file `txmain.C`.
-   \[**Version 1.9d, 2003-09-20**\] Added option -configfile.
    \[fp_num::div\]: n can be negative. Removed some commas and
    semi-colons so as to remove warnings on sun like \"txbuffer.C\",
    line 1265: Error: Cannot use const char\* to initialize char\*.
    \"txbuffer.C\", line 524: Warning: k hides the same name in an outer
    scope. `Buffer::convert` replaced by
    `Buffer::convert_to_str() const`. Removed implicit conversion from
    `Buffer` to `String` then `string`. `Buffer::the_characters()`
    renamed to `Buffer::c_str()`. Removed all calls to `sprintf`.
    `Buffer::see_something` argument is a `const String[]`, without
    backslash. Missing comma added in `bad_commands1`. bug correction:
    missing `finish_string` in `Buffer::see_year`. bug correction:
    missing `finish_string` in `bibentry::numeric_label`.
-   \[**Version 1.9e, 2003-10-06**\] Removed `Buffer::insert_braced()`
    (same as `add_braced`). Message \\begin catperso (ligne 27) \...
    \\end xcatperso replaced by \\begin{catperso} (line 27) \...
    \\end{xcatperso}. `read_a_file` and `read_a_file_spec`: same
    function. `module::sec_string` is useless. Removed:
    `rc_space, convert_dim_to_space, a_dim_to_pt, convert_dim`. Removed
    tests for `\def, \let, \newif` etc. Instead of: They were 1
    Sanstitre handled there is now: There was 1 NoTitle handled.
    \[**2003-10-10**\] \[bibtexerr\]: seeing a } changes the error type.
    Added a field `file_name` in `line_ptr`. Added a line number in the
    error messages of bibtex. Dynamic memory in `txmath.C`.
    `Parser::math_argument` replaced by `before_mac_arg()`; watch for
    differences as in `$a\hbox{}b$`. \[**2003-10-15**\] Bibtex error
    messages start with Error and end with a period. `\c{C}` is ok. In
    the case of error: too many commas and empty name, the string is
    printed. Errors detected while reading a bibtex file are better
    handled. The log starts with: Trace of tralics XX for file YY (XX=
    version number). \[array_info\]: fields are private. The
    `attributes` table is dynamic. The size was 10000 (5993 for Sosso).
    Correction of bug (idem). Supression of XML stats if tralics -ps.
    Bug in `do_indexing`. tralics -check executes `do_indexing`, prints
    nothing. tralics -check does not create files \_modules, \_delcbis
    etc. Added some const in the files.
-   \[**version 1.9i, 2003-10-16**\] Added constant `level_zero` and
    `level_one`. Anonymous `enum` changed to `name_positions`. Functions
    `push_level` and `pop_level` take another argument. Strange errors
    for `$$\begin{array}{cc}\mbox{\begin{tabular}{r|cc}...`. Renamed
    `Parser::thebuf` to `Parser::unprocessed_xml`. For `Stack::push1`,
    second arg is a `name_positions`, first arg is optional. For
    `Stack::newid0`, arg is a `name_position`. For `Parser::T_arg1`,
    `Parser::T_arg1_opt`: second arg is a `name_positions`. Added
    `Parser::nT_next_arg()`, `Parser::nT_next_optarg()`. In `txpost.C`:
    removed code dealing with `mylabel`. Renamed `st_pos_foo` into
    `sp_foo`. Removed `Stack:add_att_to_last(string,string)`. Renamed
    `Parser::buffer` to `Parser::input_buffer`. Re-implemented
    `str_hash::find` . \[**2003-10-22**\] Added a new file `txfonts.C`.
    Function `Parser::get_token` returns a boolean: true if invalid.
    Added some tests\... Functions made private in `txmath.h`. Idem for
    `xmlaction`. Bug correction: `\typeprojet` : `\localisation` is
    obsolete. `Buffer::get_wptr()` replaced by `Buffer::length()`.
    Special hack for macros like `\empty`. Some equivalents are defined
    at level one. \[**2003-10-23**\] Field `math::name` defaults to
    empty string, not null pointer (avoids core dump in
    `scan_math_aux`). Bug in `math::handle_mbox` fixed. Instead of:
    Label multiply defined apprentissage2 we have : Label
    \'apprentissage2\' multiply defined (first use line 625). Instead
    of: undefined label track-arche we have : undefined label
    \`track-arche\' (first use at line 748). No more Strange keywords
    cha\^{i}nes. Removed final dot in keywords. This is a valid keyword:
    `c{\oe}ur`. Implemented `\oldstylenums` like `\textsuperscript` and
    `\textsubscript`. Implemented `\linebreak` and `\nolinebreak` as
    no-op with optional argument. *Tralics* counts lines properly for
    Unix, Mac and Windows. If you say
    `EDITOR = {A. Drouin & G. Eude & J.Robert}` you get an error of the
    form bad syntax in author or editor name.
-   \[**version 1.9j, 2003-10-24**\] Added special hack for empty macros
    everywhere. Better error message for `\addtolength{toto}{2cm}`. Same
    for `\addtolength{\toto}{2cm}`. This is an error now:
    `\setlength{2}{4cm},        \addtolength{x}{3cm}`. Corrected error
    message for `\DefineShortVerb{a}`. Command `\ifeof` works now.
    `{\escapechar=-1 \string\foo}` gives `foo`. Implemented `\openout`,
    `\write` and `\closeout`. *Tralics* signals unterminated `\if`
    conditions. This is ok: `\iffalse \FPiflt{1}{2} \fi \toto \fi`.
    Evaluating `$\undef$` generates an understandable message.
    Evaluating `$a^b^c$` gives now : double superscript.
-   \[**version 1.9k, 2003-10-30**\] Added a missing `flush_buffer()` in
    `\bibitem`. Command `\newline` invalid in table. Function
    `T_bibitem` was completely wrong\... Attribute `rowspan` replaced by
    `columnspan` in math tables. Added a use_all_sizes option.
    \[**2003-10-30**\] Split file `txparser.C` into two parts.
    `txscan.C` is a new file. There is an indication in the log file
    whenever *Tralics* opens/closes a file. Commands `\input` and
    `\endinput` are fully expanded. Calls `\input{foo}` and `\input foo`
    are OK. Implicit call of `save_the_state` for `\input` (needed for
    `\input A\input B`). Functions `\openin` and `\closein` are always
    traced, but only sometimes on the tty. Call `\\catcode `A=9\` works
    now. Function `get_token` completely rewritten. \[print_mods\]:
    `this_line` is never zero. Added a `Stats` object that collects a
    lot of statistics.
-   \[**Version 1.9l, 2003-11-14**\] Replaced `scan_four_bit_ints` by 3
    functions. Implemented DOI (Digital Object Identifier). Added a
    -utf8, -latin1 option. `\the\par` generates the same error as in
    TeX. Use anonymous namespace instead of static variable. Removed
    `xmlstats`\... Added more Ctor to `xml_action`. \[**2003-12-10**\]
    Made `clines`, `math_p_aux`, `math_elt`, `token_elt`, `cond_aux`
    subclasses of other classes. Corrected a bug for multi `\UR`.
-   \[**Version 1.9m, 2003-12-10**\] `\>` has now the value
    `\medmuskip`. `\, \> \: \!`: same values as in MathML TR.
    `$\bigl[\frac{1}{a^2}\bigr[$` works. `$\ensuremath{\cal} X$` yields
    \\`cal`. `\RAsection` calls `leave_h_mode`. Corrected bug
    `\begin{module}...text\end{module}`. Added
    `\underleftarrow \underrightarrow`.
    `\linebreak, \nolinebreak \pagebreak \nopagebreak` -\> ok.
    `\urlfont` and `url_font` in `.tralics_rc`. `xmlelement` environment
    changed. Bug correction in `\AtBeginDocument`. No spaces from
    bootstrap code.
-   \[**version 1.9n, 2003-12-16**\] Quotes ``` \``foo'' ``` -\> gives
    the word foo. You can use `\begin{split}`. Added `\tfrac` as
    alternative to `\frac` and `\dfrac`. Added `\genfrac#1#2#3#4#5`.
    Added `\DeclareRobustCommand`. Script placement of `\lim_{x=0}` and
    `\sin^2(x)` not the same. Use of a `mstyle` element, according to
    MathML standards. Bug in `\underset`.
-   \[**version 1.9o, 2003-12-22**\] Character `~` is now active,
    expands to \~ of catcode 12. If \\`def\foo#1 #2{}`, then a newline
    is a separator between `#1` and `#2`. Added `\bye`, same as
    `\endinput`.
-   \[**version 1.9p, 2004-01-09**\] Some corrections on long arrows.
    Scope: `\paragraph{\bf foo}` : only foo is in \\`bf`.
-   \[**version 1.9q, 2004-01-09**\] Added a space after the label of
    subfigure. Replaced type `Token` by `token`. Replaced type `Stack`
    by `stack`, and `stack` by `my_stack`. Replaced type `Modes` by
    `mode`. Replaced type `Parser` by `parser`. Added classes
    `eqtb_dim`, `save_aux_dim`, and `eqtb_dim_table`. Changed Copyright
    miaou/apics. Made nested environments work. Added
    `\let\verbatimfont\tt\let\verbatimnumberfont\small`. Changed
    `\unitlength` to an internal dimension. Added `\textheight=427pt`,
    `\textwidth=570pt` Make ampersand in url work: they are like
    `\char9738` (signaled by Alain Giraud). Added `remove_last_space()`
    for `\multicolumn`. Changed: Braces in math argument.
-   \[**2004-01-15**\] Changed `\pers` to use `\@pers`. Change:
    `\pers{a}{b}[c ]` trailing space removed. Added `\tralicsversion`.
    Bug: `scan_int` at end of token list pushes back an invalid token.
    Change `\setcounter{bar}{17}` gives Unknown counter \`bar\'. Added a
    feature that counts cr-lf as two characters for Windows. So that the
    number of bytes printed is what claimed. Added trace of `\loop`.
    Seeing a closing brace does not call `flush_buffer()`; call done
    only by `save_aux_font::unsave`. Bug in `trace_if` fixed. Fct
    `if_serial` moved from `parser` class to `condition`.
-   \[**2004-01-22**\] Changed `array_info`, it holds two vectors : u
    and v. Renamed class `Buffer` as `buffer`. Added support for German.
    Change: `flush_buffer` does not create a useless XML element. Made
    code of `\par` and Co clearer. Entities: *Tralics* may output
    &\#xA0; instead of &nbsp;. This prints OK:
    `\expandafter\show\csname^^I^^85^^97\endcsname`. Bug:
    `\\catcode`\^\^I\` does not change the catcode of space. First cell

    `txparser.h` in alphabetic order, and put everything private if
    possible. Added option footnotehack. Fix. `stack::add_nl()` adds a

    by `stack::remove_last_space` used instead. This removes all spaces
    before a `</p>`. Optional argument of `\makebox` is implemented. Bug
    fix in `scan_glue`.

    of projet in all messages. Removed a goto. Variable `ref_list` is
    now a vector. `logger_ctl` removed (was useless) and printed a
    useless 0. The `short_name` attribute of module is machine

    ]{.title-ref}[includegraphics\[=foo,clip=\]{\...}]{.title-ref}[ OK.
    ]{.title-ref}[escapechar=-1]{.title-ref}[ does something sensible.
    Replacement of ]{.title-ref}[string_table]{.title-ref}[ by

    ]{.title-ref}[pack_matcher]{.title-ref}[ and other bug corrections.
    New class ]{.title-ref}[arith]{.title-ref}[ that contains
    ]{.title-ref}[radix]{.title-ref}[ and
    ]{.title-ref}[error]{.title-ref}[ and functions. Variable
    ]{.title-ref}[the_save_stack]{.title-ref}[ is a vector. Overflow in
    counter is no more fatal. Modified
    ]{.title-ref}[read_mac_body]{.title-ref}[ and
    ]{.title-ref}[read_delimited]{.title-ref}[ in order to share .
    Guillemets and space. Working on FP. Added some missing math
    symbols. \[token_list\]: new methods
    ]{.title-ref}[front]{.title-ref}[, ]{.title-ref}[back]{.title-ref}[,
    ]{.title-ref}[push_front]{.title-ref}[,

2002-12, Version 1.7
--------------------

-   \[date unknown\] In bibtex, if the citation is numeric, optional
    argument in the alpha key. Partial handling of `\begin` inside
    comments. `\catcode160=10`. Said otherwise, nonbreakspace is
    considered as a normal space. Message duplicate field ignored
    becomes duplicate field \`note\' ignored, in the case of a note.
    `\href{toto}{\url{titi}}` gives two errors unexpected element hi,
    invalid url value. the first message becomes: unexpected font change
    tt. if the second is printed, it will be you should perhaps use
    \\href{url{x}}{y} instead of \\href{y}{url{x}}.
    `editor = "\textsc{toto}"` in the biblio gives unexpected font
    change sc. maybe you confused Publisher with Editor. Bug
    corrections: `\c{c}` OK in a bibname; `\v{c}` OK ; `\a'{e}` OK. Some
    new commands: `\sharp \natural \flat \oval \updownarrow \thinspace`.
    Message Module name already seen replaced by Module name \`result\'
    already seen. `$_$` give no memory fault but Math formula should not
    finish with \_ Calling tralics -all works.
-   **\[Version 1.7a, 2002-12-20\]**
    `\htmladdnormallinkfoot{x}{\url{y}}` works. `\label{foo-bar}` and
    `\label{foo+bar}` are now distinct. Bug correction
    `\begin{table}\begin{tabular}...` is OK. Order of bibliographic
    references is not hard-coded. `\includegraphics{foo:bar}` is OK\...
    Corrected a bug in the date (first month=0). Bug in simplemath
    (`$x$=$y$` gave y=y). Bug in bibtex crossref management (copy of
    wrong thing). `read_config_file` : is OK now. *Tralics* accepts now
    empty input files. bug in etal\.... bug in `\epsfig 3pt` translated
    to `3fil`. bug in `\pers{...}{...}[{\sc xx}]` strange scope. missing
    attribute, in last cell of a tabular. added `\leavevmode` before
    `\begin{tabular}`. Problems with tables. `\footcite` puts a space
    before.

Version 1.6
-----------

-   \[date unknown\] Implementation of
    `\@ifundefined, \@ifstar, \@ifnextchar, \typeout`. Added option
    interactivemath. This prints the formulas on the the screen. No file
    is read. Instead of a message like Undefined command \\eta; command
    code = 157 you get Math only command \\eta. Missing dollar not
    inserted. Definition of `\begin{sloppypar} ... \end{sloppypar}`. In
    an url, `\~` is converted to a `~`. In an url, `_` is of catcode 13,
    and not 11, it is defined to be identical to `\_`. (problem of
    `toto\_titi_tata`). Definition of `\epsfbox`. A construction like
    `` $7^{\mbox{\scriptsize \it i\`{e}me}}$ `` works. It is like
    `7\ieme`. Added `\P`, it is like `¶`. Added
    `\line \put \bezier \qbezier \vector     \thicklines \thinlines \dashlike \drawline  \dotteline`.
    `\begin{minipage}[][][]{} ... \end{minipage}` is translated.
    Implementation of `\begin{xmlelement} ... \end{xmlelement}`.
-   **Version 1.6b** \[date unknown\] Implementation of
    `\hbox, \vbox, \xbox` etc. Silly bug `\def\foo\xbox{\foo}{}` loops
    without end. Correction of bugs in a token list. Bug in `<<~` :
    superfluous space. Bug in `\medskip\par\noindent`. Added
    `\mbox, \fbox, \makebox, \framebox` with the syntax of `picture`.
    Added the `picture` environment. Added `comment` environnement. If
    the final brace `\end{module}` is missing *Tralics* does not say :
    Unexpected end of file but indicates the line containing the `\end`.
    If you say `\htmladdnormallink{toto}(titi)` (parentheses instead of
    braces) the error will be: Invalid URL value.
-   **Version 1.6c** \[date unknown\] Bug correction: the second `\par`
    in `\par toto \par titi` was ignored (synchronisation problem).
    Added `\let\debugfalse\relax`. Instead of putting the biblio in
    `toto.bbl`, I put it in `toto_.bbl`. Bug of `\{` and `\}` in math
    mode, not completely handled. Bug of `\item[{\bf x}]`; braces
    disappear. Bug of `\begin{Verbatim} [numbers=true]`; the test of
    optional argument is strange. Bug of `\,` among others in math mode;
    there is an unwanted `<mo>`. Bug: editeur twice in case of
    \@conference. Bug of `\newcount{toto}[titi]`, the
    `\let\cl@toto\@empty` did ignore the reference count. Other bug in
    the biblio. `$$toto$$titi` inserts a `\par\noindent`. If you say
    `\newcommand{\Athapascan0}{ok}` the error message will be Attempt to
    define: \\Athapascan 0, Error signaled at line 188: Only one token
    allowed in argument list.
    `\moduleref[1539]{PROJET}{section}{module}` is an error, because I
    don\'t know how to translate into English (Everybody knows Marignan
    1515).
-   **Version 1.6d** \[date unknown\] Implementation of
    `\dotsc \dotsb \dotsi \dotsm` it\'s like `\dots`.
    `\geqslant, \leqslant` ok. \[raweb-cfg.sty\] `\ell` works fine.
    Added`\let\href\htmladdnormallink`. `\not=` and `\not\in` work.
    \[rawebfo.xsl\] added `separateur.objet` in citation/xref. Problem
    of `\href{\url{&}}{&}` This is accepted by the translator, but
    conversion to Pdf fails. Environment `cases` implemented.
    \[raweb-cfg.sty\] problem with `\item` : bullet non centered if TeX
    decides to start a new page because of the \\penalty of the \\item.
    *Tralics* signals an error if a) you say `\label{x} \label{x}`, b)
    you say `\ref{x}` without the associated `\label`, c) you say `\ref`
    and the label disappears \[thanks JB Pomet\]. `a\over b` gives
    `<mfrac>` rather than a `<mover>` \[pb. I. Vatton\]. Added
    namespaces in math elements. Order of biblio references changed.
    Implementation of
    `\input, \endinput, \IfFileExists, \InputIfFileExists`. Bug
    corrections: in `\small`, nothing happened; in `\setbox3=\hbox{}`,
    assignment was local; `{\large \hbox{\small x}}` gave an empty
    `<large>` in the hbox. `\newcommand\foo{\begin{latexonly}...` calls
    abort, instead of memory fault (project Trec). Some `(Sans titre)`
    disappear, other become `(Sans Titre)`.

Version 1.5
-----------

-   \[date unknown\] `\hspace` allowed in maths. For instance
    `$I\hspace{-0.1cm}R^n$`; Not bad in Pdf, not recognized by amaya.
    The file wmachin.cfg is not created if invalid (following a mail of
    Vincent Lefèvre). *Tralics* looks at the shell variable `TRALICSDIR`
    before `RAWEBDIR`. *Tralics* copies catalog.src in catalog in the
    current working dir replacing `source_directory` by whatever needed
    (catalog.src is a new file, to be added in the package).
    `\includegraphics{toto.ps}`, `\includegraphics{a.b.c}` are
    translated into `<graphics file='toto'/> <graphics file='a.b.c'/>`.
    Correction of a silly bug for the Sharp Team. A second one. The
    error message Non character found in environment name: becomes
    Non-character found in \\includegraphics. (For the Sharp Team).
    Added a new error message that reads Things like {\'{}} are a bit
    strange (they use it for an apostrophe). Implementation of
    `\uppercase`, \\`lowercase`, `\MakeUppercase`, `\MakeLowercase`.
    Add/test of the commands
    `\oe\OE\o\O\ae\AE\dh\DH\dj\DJ\l\L\ng\NG\ss\SS\th\TH` (`\ng`, `\NG`
    do not work, `\dj` is strange). Problem `\oe` does not work in HTML.
    `\mbox{\sc Vasy}` is translated as `{\sc Vasy}`.
    `\begin{quote} ... \end{quote}` is OK. Idem with `flushleft` and
    `flushright`. `\raggedleft` `\raggedright` OK. (must modify
    rawebhtml.xsl and rawebfo.xsl).
    `\begin{wrapfigure}{x}{y} ... \end{wrapfigure}` is handled as
    `\begin{figure}[x] ... \end{figure}`. (putting a figure near some
    text works only if somebody checks that the layout is OK). Silly
    bug. You should not see something like Checked 1 keyword env with 14
    keywords (13 unique) because there are 15 words, all different.
    `\ensuremath{\alpha}` works. `$\ensuremath{\beta}$` puts too many
    braces, but there are other functions that do the same. Must correct
    this one day.
