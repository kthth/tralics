Command-line options
====================

*Tralics* knows about many options, that start with a single or double
hyphen. Some options take an argument, that is placed just after the
option, the syntax option=argument, without spaces is allowed. You can
also use spaces (option, space, equals, space, argument). Some options
are shown with an underscore, it is optional. They are the following, in
alphabetic order:

-confdir=*prefix*

:   This is a prefix for an alternate location of tcf, ult, plt, and clt
    files. More than one prefix can be given, all will be used (latest
    first). Since version 2.11.4, the configuration file .tralics_rc is
    searched in this list, if not found in the current directory.

-compatibility

:   Keeps compatibility with older versions.

-config=*FILE*

:   Use FILE instead of default configuration file. This can be an
    absolute or relative pathname.

-config_file=*FILE*

:   Same as -config=FILE.

-default_class=*CLASS*

:   Assume that you compile a file that has `\documentclass{foo}`; in
    this case, *Tralics* tries to read the file foo.clt. No error is
    signaled if the file cannot be opened. If you call *Tralics* with
    option -default_class=bar, then bar.clt is loaded in the case
    foo.clt does not exists; the command `\CurrentClass` will hold the
    name of the document class (here "foo"), so that bar.clt knows how
    it was called.

-distinguish_refer_in_rabib=true/false

:   This indicates whether, for the raweb, the "refer" bibliography
    database should be considered a normal file, or a subfile for the
    year database. Values other than yes, no, true, false, are ignored.
    Default is yes. The configuration may also specify
    distinguish_refer_in_rabib=xx. In case of conflit, the parameter is
    used. Values other than yes, no, true and false are ignored. Details
    are explained in section [2.8 Bibliography](raweb.html#rabib).

-doctype=*A-B*

:   This specifies the DOCTYPE of the resulting XML document. Here A is
    the name of the root element, B is the name of the DTD file. The two
    quantities A and B are separated by a dash or a space (in this case,
    quotes are needed, so that \"A B\" read as a single argument).

-dualmath

:   The LaTeX source of math formulas is added to the MathML expression.
    This is the same as using `\@nomathml=-3` in the document (see
    [documentation](doc-n.html#cmd-nomathml))

-entnames=yes/no

:   This tells *Tralics* to put `&alpha;` or `&#x3B1;` in the XML
    output. If entity names are used, the resulting XML file can be used
    only if the DTD explains how they are defined. Since version 2.9,
    this option applies only to math characters, that are described in
    the MathMM DTD.

-etex

:   This option enables e-TeX extensions. Options are enabled by
    default.

-find_words

:   The list of all words of the XML tree will be printed on the file
    words, after translation is complete.

-help

:   The list of main options are printed, and the program stops.

-input_data =*VALUE*

:   In this case *Tralics* translates the content of the argument VALUE
    and prints the translation of all math formulas it sees (and nothing
    else). No XML file is generated. No error is printed. The transcript
    file is texput.log.

-input_dir =*DIR*

:   Specifies where source files are to be found. This is a colon
    separated list of directories; current directory is defined by an
    empty slot, or a single dot. It will be added to the end of the
    list, unless present.

-input_path = *DIR*

:   Same as input-dir=DIR

-input_file =*FILE*

:   This tells *Tralics* to compile file FILE (.tex suffix added if
    needed)

-interactivemath, -i

:   Special interactive mode, in which characters are read from the
    terminal, instead a file, and math formulas are printed on the
    screen. Input encoding is UTF-8 (it will be latin1 if option -latin1
    comes after option -i).

-latin1

:   This option means that input files are by default encoded in
    iso-8859-1 mode (if the first line of the file contains
    `-*-  coding: utf-8` it is read in UTF-8 mode).

-leftquote=*xxx*

:   Defines translation of left quote (or backquote); see below under
    rightquote.

-log_file =*FILE*

:   This tells *Tralics* to put all messages and warnings in FILE
    (extension .log added if not given); the file is locate in the
    directory specified by output_dir. Defaut value is the name of the
    input file.

-math_variant

:   If you say -math_variant then `$\mathfrak B$` translates into
    `<mi mathvariant='fraktur' >B</mi>`. If you say -no_math_variant
    then `$\mathcal A$` translates into `<mi>&#x1D49C;</mi>` or
    `<mi>&Ascr;</mi>`. Before version 2.9.4, the result depended on the
    font. The default is to use Unicode characters rather than
    attributes.

-multi_math_label

:   This option sets the counter `\multi@math@label` to 1. By default
    the counter is zero, and a math formula has at most one equation
    number, so at most one label, anchored to the `<formula>` element.
    If the counter is 1, then a math formula , for instance defined by
    the `split` environment, has an equation number per row, and one
    label is allowed for each `<mrow>` element. New in version 2.15.4

-noconfig

:   No configuration file will be used.

-noentnames

:   This is the same as entnames=no. This tells *Tralics* to put
    `&#x3B1;` rather than `&alpha;` in the XML output. See option
    -entnames above.

-noetex

:   This option disables e-TeX extensions. Options are enabled by
    default.

-no_float_hack

:   This option disables the postprocessor for tables and figures.

-nomathml

:   Math formulas are output Ã  la TeX, rather than using MathML. This is
    the same as using `\@nomathml=-1` in the document. (see
    [documentation](doc-n.html#cmd-nomathml))

-no_math_variant

:   This is the converse of -math_variant described above.

-no_multi_math_label

:   This is the converse of -multi_math_label described above.

-notrivialmath

:   Inhibits trivial math hacks; see option trivialmath below. Since
    version 2.8.5 the default is trivialmath=1.

-noundefmac

:   If you issue this option, all commands will be magically defined
    after the first error message saying that the command is undefined.

-nostraightquotes

:   If you issue this option, the apostrophe translates into character
    U+B4, as `\textasciiacute`. However, the normal value is used in
    verbatim mode, when reading a file name, in an URL, or in a
    construct like `\char'`.

-noxmlerror

:   This option inhibits creation of `<error/>` elements in case of
    error. These elements can be useful for debugging, since they
    indicate the current position in the tree; on the other hand, they
    could generate a second error, of the form: *expected element
    error*.

-nozerowidthelt

:   In order to inhibit ligatures when converting XML to Pdf some action
    is required: a special character (zero width space) is added. This
    character appears sometimes as a normal-width-space. As a
    consequence, the `<zws/>` is used (and the style sheet that converts
    XML to HTML can ignore this element); If this switch is used,
    character entity `#x200B;` is used instead of an element.

-nozerowidthspace

:   Translation of `\verb=--=` is
    `<hi rend='xml_in'>-&#x200B;-&#x200B;</hi>`. The ZeroWidthSpace
    character (or some element, see above) is added so that, in case the
    XML file is interpreted by a software like TeX, no en-dash ligature
    is created. This behavior is inhibited by the switch.

-oe8, -oe1, -oe8a, -oe1a

:   This specifies output encoding, one of UTF8 or latin1.
    Interpretation of the XML file is independent of the encoding. If
    the letter a is given, then all non-7 bits characters are printed as
    character references. Thus, the only difference between option e8a
    and oe1a is the XML header line. Defaut encoding is UTF8.

-oldphi

:   This is a compatiblity option, which gives a wrong translation for
    `\phi \varphi`.

-output_dir =*DIR*

:   Specifies the directory in which output files are to be stored (this
    concerns the main XML file, the transcript file, and other files).
    By default, this is the directory containing the input file.

-output_file =*FILE*

:   This tells *Tralics* to put the result in FILE (extension .xml added
    if not given). \[In the case of the raweb, this option is ignored\]

-param=*FOO=BAR*

:   The effect is the same as if FOO=\"BAR\" were in the configuration
    file, after all other values. Syntax is a bit special: both equal
    signs can be replaced by a space.

-raw-bib

:   If this option is givem, *Tralics* considers all bibtex entry types
    alike. Otherwise, it may ignore irrelevant fields (for instance,
    editor for a phdthesis).

-rightquote= *xxx*

:   Defines translation of right quote (or apostrophe). Characters
    \`(left quote) and \' (right quote) must have category code 12
    (other) otherwise some constructions fail. In verbatim mode, (as
    well as in Urls) these characters behave normally; if doubled,
    translation is U+201C and U+201D (" and "). Otherwise you can
    change. If you say -leftquote=2018 and -rightquote=2019 then
    characters U+2018 and U+2019 are used (' and '). Only base16 digits
    are allowed; the value should be a number between 1 and 2\^16
    (otherwise default value is used).

-shell-escape

:   If you issue this command, `\write18{pwd}` will execute the \`pwd\'
    command.

-silent

:   This makes *Tralics* less verbose (prints the title of a \`div0\'
    instead of \`div0\' or \`div1\'; prints less statistics; omits image
    info).

-te8, -te1, -te8a, -te1a

:   This specifies encoding used in transcript files. In the case of te8
    or te8a, characters are printed using UTF-8 format; in the case of
    te1 ot te1a, characters are printed using latin1 encoding.
    Characters are printed using the \^\^\^\^abcd notation in case: the
    value if greater than 255, and one of -te8a, -te1a is given, or the
    character is not in proper range (32-126 plus 160-155) and te1 is
    given, the character is smaller then 32. Note: horizontal
    tabulation, line-feed and carriage return do not use the \^\^
    notation. Default: same as output encoding.

-tpa_status=*XX*

:   This flags controls what is to be translated if the configuration
    file specifies a titlepage (see [description](titlepage.html)). If
    the value is \`all\', then the whole document is translated; if the
    value is \`title\', only the titlepage is translated; if the value
    is \`config\', action depends on the configuration file (details can
    be found [here](titlepage.html#titlepage-action)). Otherwise,
    translation stops in case of an error, continues otherwise. Only the
    first character of the value is tested. Capital letters are allowed.

-trivialmath=*N*

:   This sets the counter `notrivialmath` to N. If N is 7, *Tralics*
    replaces `$12^{th}$` by `12\textsuperscript{th}`, and handles
    formulas like `$x$` as \`trivial math\' formulas. Translation is
    `<formula type='inline'>  <simplemath>x</simplemath> </formula>`
    instead of a more complicated MathML expression. No MathML
    expression is created in the case of `$\alpha$` or `$_{foo}$`.
    Default value of the counter is 1.

-type=*FOO*

:   Uses FOO instead of the \\documentclass value for the document type.
    If you say tralics -type ra hello, this will read the ra.tcf file,
    enter Raweb mode and fail; on the other hand, if miaou2003.tex is a
    raweb file, tralics -type ra2007 miaou2003 may fail because the
    configuration file for year 2007 may be incompatible with that
    of 2003.

-usequotes

:   This option converts double quotes into a pair of single quotes,
    either left quotes, or right quotes.

-utf8

:   This option means that input files are by default encoded in UTF-8
    mode (if the first line of the file contains
    `-*- coding: iso-8859-1` it is read in latin1 mode).

-utf8output

:   Same as option -oe8 -te8.

-verbose, -v

:   This makes *Tralics* more verbose. In particular, you will see how
    *Tralics* determines the DTD. It executes `\tracingall` (in the
    example of miaou, this prints 9233 lines instead of 142 in the
    transcript file).

-verbose-doc, -V

:   The effect of this switch is to execute `\tracingall` when
    `\begin{document}` is seen; this is like the `verbose` switch, but
    you won\'t see all details of classes and packages.

-version

:   Version number is printed; program stops.

-year=*XXXX*

:   This option sets an internal count register, accessible via the
    command `` `ra@year `` \<doc-r.html\#cmd-rayear\>\`\_\_. The default
    value is the current year, with an offset: (for this purpose year
    2005 starts at May, 1st, and terminates at the last of April 2006).
    You cannot use the option when compiling the Raweb, and the year is
    extracted from the file name.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following options were once used for the Raweb; they have been
removed in version 2.13.

-all

:   Is the same as -xml -xmlfo -xmlhtml -xmltex -xmllint.

-check

:   This checks the syntax, but produces nothing (no XML, no LaTeX).
    Does nothing outside Raweb mode.

-dir=*RADIR*

:   This explains that RADIR is the directory containing lots of stuff
    for the Raweb mode. In particular, it contains a subdirectory
    confdir with the configuration file. If this option is not used, the
    value of the shell variable `TRALICSDIR` will be used instead.

-external_prog=*XXX*

:   In this case XXX will be used instead of rahandler.pl as interpreter
    for the raweb actions defined by the xmlXXX switches.

-hacknotitle

:   If you give this option, *Tralics* may replace `\section{}` by
    `\section{Introduction}`. This is implied in raweb mode until 2006.
    The option was withdrawn in 2007: using it has no effect on the
    translation.

-interactivebib

:   Withdrawn option.

-nobibyearerror

:   Useful in Raweb mode only. No error is signaled if you cite a paper
    of year X in year Y when X and Y are not the same.

-nobibyearmodify

:   Useful in Raweb mode only. No modification done if an entry is in
    the refer section instead of being in the year section. Details are
    explained in section [2.8 Bibliography](raweb.html#rabib).

-ps

:   This checks the syntax, creates a TeX file instead of XML, and calls
    an external program to convert the TeX into PostScript. Does nothing
    outside Raweb mode.

-radebug

:   This option tells the Raweb checker to continue checking after the
    first error instead of stopping immediately; note that the
    translator is not called if the Raweb checker sees an error.

-xml

:   This option asks *Tralics* to convert the TeX source into an XML
    result. Is incompatible with options -check or -ps. Is selected,
    when compiling the Raweb, if neither -ps nor -check is given.

-xmlall

:   Is the same as -xml -xmlfo -xmlhtml -xmltex -xmllint.

-xmlfo

:   This asks for the creation, via an external program, of a xsl-fo
    file. It implies the -xml option. Is meaningful only in Raweb mode,
    where an external program is launched.

-xmlhtml

:   This asks for the creation, via an external program, of a set of
    HTML files. It implies the -xml option. Is meaningful only in Raweb
    mode, where an external program is launched.

-xmllint

:   This checks, via an external program, the validity of the XML
    against the DTD. It implies the -xml option. Is meaningful only in
    Raweb mode, where an external program is launched.

-xmltex

:   This asks for the conversion, via an external program, of the xsl-fo
    file to a Pdf file. Implies -xml and -xmlfo. Is meaningful only in
    Raweb mode, where an external program is launched.
