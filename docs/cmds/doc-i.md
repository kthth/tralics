------------------------------------------------------------------------

\\i, \\I (constant) {#cmd-i}
-------------------

The `\i` command is valid in math mode and text mode. It generates an i
without dot (Unicode U+131, Ä±). The `\I` command expands to `I`, but is
converted to `\i` by `\MakeLowercase`.

See description of the [\\qquad](doc-q.html#cmd-qquad) command and
`` `\AA `` \<doc-a.html\#cmd-Caa\>\`\_\_ command.

\\\@ident {#cmd-ident}
---------

The `\@ident` command is another name for `\@firstofone`, it takes an
argument and returns it.

\\idotsint {#cmd-idotsint}
----------

The command `\idotsint` behaves `\int...\int`, except that it is
declared as single operators with limits (an index will be under the
whole expression).

\\ier {#cmd-ier}
-----

The `\ier` command translates to `&ier;`, an entity defined by the
raweb. Behavior changed in version 2.8.2, see example below and
[here](#new-fa).

\\iere {#cmd-iere}
------

The `\iere` command translates to `&iere;`, an entity defined by the
raweb. Behavior changed in version 2.8.2, see example below and
[here](#new-fa).

\\iers {#cmd-iers}
------

The `\iers` command translates to `&iers;`, an entity defined by the
raweb. Behavior changed in version 2.8.2, see example below and
[here](#new-fa).

\\ieres {#cmd-ieres}
-------

The `\ieres` command translates to `&ieres;`, an entity defined by the
raweb. Behavior changed in version 2.8.2, see example below and
[here](#new-fa).

\\ieme {#cmd-ieme}
------

The `\ieme` command translates to `&ieme;`, an entity defined by the
raweb. Behavior changed in version 2.8.2, see example below and
[here](#new-fa).

\\iemes {#cmd-iemes}
-------

| The `\iemes` command translates to `&iemes;`, an entity defined by the
  raweb. Behavior changed in version 2.8.2, see [here](#new-fa).
| Example

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    1\ier 1\iere 1\iers 1\ieres 2\ieme 2\iemes

Translation:

::: {.container .xml_out}
    1&ier;1&iere;1&iers;1&ieres;2&ieme;2&iemes;

Part of the raweb dtd that defines the entities:

::: {.container .xml_out}
    <!ENTITY  ier "<hi rend='sup'>er</hi>">
    <!ENTITY  iers "<hi rend='sup'>ers</hi>">
    <!ENTITY  iere "<hi rend='sup'>re</hi>">
    <!ENTITY  ieres "<hi rend='sup'>res</hi>">
    <!ENTITY  ieme "<hi rend='sup'>e</hi>">
    <!ENTITY  iemes "<hi rend='sup'>es</hi>">
:::

Preview: ![french abbrevs](/img/img_66.png)

If a standalone XML document is required, it is not possible to insert
entities like those defined above; the first idea was then to insert the
replacement text, so that the translation of `\ieme` would be
`<hi rend='sup'>e</hi>`. However, it is better to translate this the
same way as `\textsuperscript{e}` (see `` `\rm ``
\<doc-r.html\#cmd-rm\>[\_\_ for how to change the translation of font
commands). Since version 2.8.2, this is the translation of
]{.title-ref}[ier]{.title-ref}[ and friends, as well as
]{.title-ref}[numero]{.title-ref}[ and friends. Moreover, the
]{.title-ref}[xspace]{.title-ref}[ is inserted, so that a space after
the command remains in most cases. Note that frenchb defines these as
]{.title-ref}[defier{up{lowercase{er}}xspace}]{.title-ref}[ and
]{.title-ref}[DeclareRobustCommand\*{no}{nup{lowercase{o}}kern+.2em}]{.title-ref}\`.
Translation:

::: {.container .xml_out}

     rend='sup'>res</hi> 2<hi rend='sup'>e</hi> 2<hi rend='sup'>es</hi> n<hi
     rend='sup'>o</hi> N<hi rend='sup'>o</hi>
:::

\\if {#cmd-if}
----

The `\if` command is used to compare two tokens. For instance `\if AB`
evaluates to false, `\if AA` evaluates to true. See below for what
happens after the test is found true or false. The token after `\if` is
expanded, until an non-expandable token is found. This is done twice,
and these two tokens are compared. (if `\else` or `\fi` is seen when
scanning, then `\relax` is inserted, see last two examples). If you say
`\def\foo{}\def\bar{OOK!}`, then `\if\foo\bar` will be true, because O
is compared to O (and two characters are left to be read-again). Two
characters compare equal if the have the same internal code (regardless
of their `\catcodes`). Two commands compare equal, and a command is
never a character.

\\if\... {#cmd-ifxxx}
--------

There are several conditionals, that share the same structure. A
construction like`\if AB X\else Y\fi` evaluates to Y, because comparing
A and B gives false, so that everything up to the `\else` token is
discarded. On the other hand, `\if AA X\else Y\fi` evaluates to X (there
is a space before the X). In this case everything between `\else` and
`\fi` is discarded. In some cases (in a `\edef` or after `\expandafter`)
it is important to specify the exact meaning of \`[evaluation\'\'. In
fact, all conditional tokens (]{.title-ref}[if]{.title-ref}[,
]{.title-ref}[else]{.title-ref}[, ]{.title-ref}[fi]{.title-ref}\`, etc.)
can be expanded.

The first operation involved in an `\if`-like command is to determine
the truth value (in the case of `\if ABCD` the tokens A and B are read,
compared, found unequal; the test is false, characters CD are not yet
read; in the case of `\unless\if ABCD`, comparison yields false and the
test is true). If the test is true, this is remembered (a special token
is pushed on the conditional stack), expansion is finished. If the test
is false, tokens are read, up to `\else` or `\fi`. If `\fi` is seen,
expansion of the conditional is terminated. Otherwise, expansion is also
terminated, but the fact that the condition is not yet finished is
remembered (a token is pushed on the conditional stack).

The case of `\ifcase\foo c0\or c1\or c2 \or c3 \else c4\fi` is special.
Here the quantity `\foo` should evaluate to an integer. The expansion is
c0 if the integer is 0, c1 if the integer is one, c2 if the integer is
2, c3 if the integer is 3, and c4 otherwise. If the integer is 0,
expansion is complete, and an if-case conditional is pushed on the
stack. Otherwise, all tokens up to `\or`, `\else` or `\fi` are
discarded. If `\fi` is seen, the situation is the same as in the case
`\iffalse` without `\else` part. If `\else` is seen, the situation is
the same as in the case `\iffalse` with an `\else` part. Otherwise, this
scanning is repeated N times (when N is the value of `\foo`). Expansion
is then terminated (an if-case conditional is pushed on the stack). (in
the example above, if the integer is 2, everything is read, but
`c2 \or c3 \else c4\fi`).

When a command like `\fi`, `\else`, `\or` is seen, different things can
happen. If the conditional stack is empty, it is an error. An `\or`
token is valid only if the stack contains a if-case conditional; all
tokens up to the next `\fi` are discarded. An `\else` token is valid
everywhere (but not after `\else`); all tokens up to the next `\fi` are
discarded In each case, the conditional is terminated, and the stack is
popped. The `` `\loop `` \<doc-l.html\#cmd-loop\>[\_\_ command uses
]{.title-ref}[expandafteriteratefi]{.title-ref}[. The idea is to pop the
conditional stack before calling ]{.title-ref}[iterate]{.title-ref}\`,
this avoids overflowing the stack.

In the discussion above, it is the value of the token that imports, not
its name. After `\let\Else\else`, you can use `\Else` instead of
`\else`. After `\def\myelse{\else}`, you can say `\if AA\X\myelse Y\fi`:
the `\myelse` command is expanded after \\X is evaluated (let\'s assume
that evaluating `\X` does not read the token that follows, start another
conditional, etc). In the case `\if AB \X\myelse Y\fi` the test is
false, and `\X` is not evaluated, `\myelse` neither. Thus `\myelse` is
not recognized as an `\else`.

In a case like `\if... \ifhph...\fi ... \else ... \fi` you can say
`\def\yes{\if00}` and `\let\ifhph\yes`. If the test is true, then
`\ifhph` is expanded and considered as a conditional, otherwise it is
not; as a consequence, the first `\fi` terminates the inner or the outer
`\if` and the second `\fi` is sometimes spurious. The `\iftrue` command
has the same meaning as `\yes`, but it is always recognized as a
conditional.

You can say things like `\count0=2\ifnum\count0=\count13\fi4`. The
important point is that the scanint routine calls expand in order to get
the next digit, hence interprets conditionals. You would expect 24 to be
put in `\count0`. After `\tracingall` the following code

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \count0=7 
    \count1=7
    \count0=2\ifnum\count0=\count1 3\fi4
:::

produces the following lines in the transcript file.

::: {.container .log_out}
    [2956] \count0=2\ifnum\count0=\count1 3\fi4
    {\count}
    +scanint for \count->0
    +\ifnum1238
    +scanint for \count->0
    +scanint for \ifnum->7
    +scanint for \count->1
    +scanint for \ifnum->7
    +iftest1238 true
    +\fi1238
    +scanint for \count->234
    {changing \count0=7 into \count0=234}
:::

You can see here that each conditional has a number (used only for
debugging purposes). In this example, the scanning of the number that is
put in `\count0` is ended by the space induced by the end of line. The
`\ifnum` test uses the old value.

Same example, as above, without the space in `\count13`. We assume that
`\count0=7` and `\count13=0` The test is false, and 24 is put in
`\count0`.

::: {.container .log_out}
    [2961] \count0=2\ifnum\count0=\count13\fi4
    {\count}
    +scanint for \count->0
    +\ifnum1239
    +scanint for \count->0
    +scanint for \ifnum->7
    +\fi1239
    +scanint for \count->13
    +scanint for \ifnum->0 
    +iftest1239 false
    +\fi1239
    +scanint for \count->24
    {changing \count0=7 into \count0=24}
:::

If you wonder why `\fi1239` appears twice, let\'s consider this

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \count0=7 
    \count13=7
    \count0=2\ifnum\count0=\count13\fi4
:::

Here, the test is true. The transcript file says:

::: {.container .log_out}
    [2967] \count0=2\ifnum\count0=\count13\fi4
    {\count}
    +scanint for \count->0
    +\ifnum1240
    +scanint for \count->0
    +scanint for \ifnum->7
    +\fi1240
    +scanint for \count->13
    +scanint for \ifnum->7
    +iftest1240 true
    +scanint for \count->2
    {changing \count0=7 into \count0=2}
    {\relax}
    +\fi1240
    Character sequence: 4 .
:::

What happens is the following: when `\fi1239` or `\fi1240` is seen, the
truth value of the condition is not yet known, because the number in
`\count13` is not evaluated. In such a case, TeX pushes back the `\fi`
and inserts `\relax`. *Tralics* does the same. Hence, the expression
that is effectively interpreted is
`\count0= 2\ifnum \count0 =\count 13\relax \fi 4` (spaces added for
readability). Thus, the expansion of `\if...\fi` is empty if the test is
false, `\relax` otherwise. So the full expression is `\count0=24` if the
test is false `\count0=2\relax4` otherwise.

What about `{\def\relax{0}\xdef\foo{\ifnum0=0\fi}}` ? This puts `\relax`
in `\foo`. There is a trick: this token is not the same token as the one
that follows the `\def`, since otherwise `0\fi` would expand to
`0\relax\fi` then `00\fi`, then `00\relax\fi` without end (and without
overflow).

\\ifcase {#cmd-ifcase}
--------

The `\ifcase` command reads a number, and expands according to some
clauses. See [\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for details. We give as an
example of how to convert a character into a letter. Here, if the
argument is not a number, an error is signaled. If the value if zero,
the expansion is empty. If the number is negative or greater then 26,
the expansion is `\@ctrerr`. There is also the macro used by the babel
system for typesetting German months; no error is signaled for invalid
month values.

:::

\\ifcat {#cmd-ifcat}
-------

The `\ifcat` command is used to compare two tokens. For instance
`\ifcat a0` evaluates to false, `\ifcat AB` evaluates to true. See
[\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the case where the
test is true or false. Tokens after `\ifcat` are evaluated, until
unexpandable tokens remain, they are compared via catcodes
(non-character tokens have `\catcode16` in this test).

    }
:::

\\\@ifclasslater, \\\@ifpackagelater {#cmd-ifclasslater}
------------------------------------

The commands `\@ifclasslater` or `\@ifpackagelater` take four arguments,
P, D, A and B; they evaluate the token list A in case the class or
package P is loaded with a date more recent than D, the token list B
otherwise.

\\\@ifclassloaded, \\\@ifpackageloaded {#cmd-ifclassloaded}
--------------------------------------

The commands `\@ifclassloaded` and `\@ifpackageloaded` take three
arguments, P, A and B; they evaluate the token list A in case the class
or package P is loaded, the token list B otherwise.

\\\@ifclasswith, \\\@ifpackagewith {#cmd-ifclasswith}
----------------------------------

The commands `\@ifclasswith` or `\@ifpackagewith` take four arguments,
P, L, A and B; they evaluate the token list A in case the class or
package P is loaded with options L, the token list B otherwise. The
order of elements in L is irrelevant, the test is true if the package
has been loaded with additional options.

\\ifcsname (eTeX extension) {#cmd-ifcsname}
---------------------------

The command `\ifcsname` is a conditional, defined by Îµ-TeX. It reads and
expands all tokens as `\csname`, until finding `\endcsname`. The
condition is true if the token exists and is defined. If the token does
not exists, it will not be created. In LaTeX, `\@ifundefined` call
`\csname`, but has as side effect that the resulting token is never
undefined. See [\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the
case where the test is true or false.

\\ifdefined (eTeX extension) {#cmd-ifdefined}
----------------------------

The command `\ifdefined` is a conditional, defined by Îµ-TeX. It reads a
token and its truth value is true if this token is defined. See
[\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the case where the
test is true or false.

\\ifdim {#cmd-ifdim}
-------

The `\ifdim` command is used to compare two dimensions. For instance
`\ifdim 0pt<1pt` evaluates to true, `\ifdim 0cm=1cm` `\ifdim 0ex>1ex`
evaluates to false. See [\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what
happens in the case where the test is true or false. The dimensions are
read by [scandimen](doc-s.html#fct-scandimen) (scanning a dimension may
involve macro-expansion, hence evaluation of conditionals). The first
dimension must be followed by optional spaces and a character (of
`\catcode` 12) chosen among \<, =, \>. Examples.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \ifdim 0pt<1pt \else\BUG\fi
    \ifdim 0pt=1pt \BUG\fi
    \ifdim 0pt>1pt \BUG\fi

    \ifdim -3pt=-2pt \BUG\fi
    \ifdim -3pt>-2pt  \BUG\fi

    \ifdim 1\ifnum2<3 4\else6\fi pt\equalsign 14pt \else \BUG \fi
    \ifdim 1\ifnum2>3 4\else6\fi pt\equalsign 14pt \BUG \fi
:::

\\\@ifbempty \\\@iftempty (Tralics commands) {#cmd-ifempty}
--------------------------------------------

These two commands take 3 arguments, L, A, B they evaluate A if L is
empty, and B otherwise. The command `\@ifbempty` removes blank spaces in
its first argument; the command `\@iftempty` does nothing special, it
could be defined as

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \long \def \@iftempty#1{%
      \ifx @#1@%
      \expandafter \@firstoftwo \else
      \expandafter \@secondoftwo \fi
    }
:::

The two commands `\@firstoftwo` and `\@secondoftwo` are implemented in
Tralics version v2.7 (the code is trivial, see below); thanks to the
`\expandafter` they are evaluated after the `\fi`, this allows arguments
A and B to be commands that read some arguments. The definition that
follows comes from amsart, it matches the semantics of the *Tralics*
command `\@ifbempty` (which is more efficient, since it uses a C++
command for testing that the token list contains only spaces).

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \let\@xp=\expandafter
    \def\@firstoftwo#1#2{#1}
    \def\@secondoftwo#1#2{#2}

    \long\def\@ifempty#1{\@xifempty#1@@..\@nil}
    \long\def\@xifempty#1#2@#3#4#5\@nil{%
      \ifx#3#4\@xp\@firstoftwo\else\@xp\@secondoftwo\fi}
:::

The behavior of this code is the following. We take the first argument,
append two at-sign characters, two dots, and a special token, then read
everything up to the special token. You lose if the special token
appears in the argument. Otherwise, the first token is discarded, the
test is: are the two tokens after the first at-sign the same. Case one,
the argument is empty: we discard the first at-sign, compare the two
dots, and the test is true. Case two: there is no at-sign in the first
argument, the test compares the at-sign and the dot, the test is false.
Case three: there is an at-sign in the argument, and the result may be
unexpected. Notice that category codes have to match; the at-sign in
`\@xifempty` has category letter (otherwise the command name is
illegal), so the macro has the correct behavior if it contains normal
(non-letter) at-sign characters.

Note that when the outer macro calls the inner one, a pair of braces can
be removed, so that, if the argument is `{ }`, only the space is
transmitted, and then ignored when the inner macro looks for the first
argument (since this is an undelimited argument).

\\ifeof {#cmd-ifeof}
-------

You can say `\ifeof N ... \else ...\fi`. Here N must be a valid input
channel number (between 0 and 15, see [scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint)
for details). The test is true, unless channel N is opened and not yet
closed. See `` `\openin `` \<doc-o.html\#cmd-openin\>[\_\_ for an
example. See ]{.title-ref}\\if\... \<doc-i.html\#cmd-ifxxx\>\`\_\_ for
what happens in case the test is true.

\\iff (constant) {#cmd-iff}
----------------

The `\iff` command (if and only if) is an other name for
`\Longleftrightarrow`. The translation is
`<mo>&Longleftrightarrow;</mo>` (Unicode U+21D4, â). See also
description of the `` `\smallint `` \<doc-s.html\#cmd-smallint\>\`\_\_
command.

\\iffalse {#cmd-iffalse}
---------

The command `\iffalse` is a conditional whose truth value is always
false. See [\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the case
where the test is true or false. See the TeXbook chapter 20 for
usefulness of such a command.

\\IfFileExists {#cmd-iffileexists}
--------------

If you say `\IfFileExists{name}{true-code}{false-code}`, then *Tralics*
converts `name` into a character string, and tries to open a file of
this name. In the case of success, `true-code` is executed, otherwise
`false-code` is executed. The command can be followed by an optional
plus sign. If this case *Tralics* checks for the name in the current
directory only. Otherwise, the file is searched in the input path;
moreover, if the name is not terminated by \`.tex\', then the extension
is added and the file is searched again.

In the example that follows, no error message should be printed

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \IfFileExists{nohope}{\errmessage{bad1}}{}
    \IfFileExists{\jobname}{}{\errmessage{bad2}}
:::

\\iffontchar {#cmd-iffontchar}
------------

The command `\iffontchar` is a conditional; it reads a font identifier,
and a character position, and evaluates to true in the case where this
character is defined in the font. For instance
`` \\iffontchar\font`a 1\else 2\fi `` evaluates to 1, unless the current
font does not contain the letter a (this is not a very useful font).
Since *Tralics* does not read font metric files, nothing special
happens, we pretend that the character exists, unless the font is the
null font. See [\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the
case where the test is true or false.

\\ifhbox {#cmd-ifhbox}
--------

The command `\ifhbox` is a conditional; it reads a box number N, the
test is true if the box contains a hbox. In *Tralics*, N should be a
number between 0 and 1023. The test is always false (because box
registers contain XML elements, that are neither hbox nor vbox). See
[\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the case where the
test is true or false.

\\ifhmode {#cmd-ifhmode}
---------

This tests if the current mode is horizontal mode. See `` `\ifvmode ``
\<doc-i.html\#cmd-ifvmode\>\`\_\_ for details.

\\ifinner {#cmd-ifinner}
---------

This tests if the current mode is inner (restricted) mode. See
`` `\ifvmode `` \<doc-i.html\#cmd-ifvmode\>\`\_\_ for details.

\\ifmmode {#cmd-ifmmode}
---------

This tests if the current mode is math mode. See `` `\ifvmode ``
\<doc-i.html\#cmd-ifvmode\>\`\_\_ for details.

\\\@ifnextchar, \\\@ifnextcharacter {#cmd-ifnextchar}
-----------------------------------

You can say `\@ifnextchar{char}{yes-code}{no-code}`. The result depends
on the token that follows. If this token is the same as the first
argument, then `yes-code` is executed, otherwise `no-code` is executed.
The first argument should be a single token (for instance a character).
Spaces are ignored. There is a variant `\@ifnextcharacter` where the
test is true if the two tokens are character tokens with same value and
possibly different category code; In LaTeX, `\futurelet` is used to grab
the next character. Example.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\normal#1#2{=#1=#2=}
    \def\withbrackets[#1]#2{\normal{#1}{#2}}
    \def\withoutbrackets#1{\normal{}{#1}}
    \def\foo{\@ifnextchar[\withbrackets\withoutbrackets}
    \foo[1]{2}\foo34
:::

This is the content of the transcript file that shows the expansion of
the two occurrences of `\foo`.

that can give a default value to an optional argument. It makes the
`\withoutbrackets` command useless.

:::

This example demonstrates `\@ifnextcharacter`. The command `\testa`
shown here is a copy of `\XKV@testopta` from the xkeyval package. It
takes a token list as argument, reads two optional flags (star and
plus), sets boolean values accordingly, then executes the code (that may
read some arguments).

:::

\\ifnum {#cmd-ifnum}
-------

The `\ifnum` command is used to compare two integers. For instance
`\ifnum 0<1` evaluates to true, `\ifnum 0=1` `\ifnum 0>1` evaluates to
false. See [\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the case
where the test is true or false. The numbers are read by
[scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint) (scanning a number may involve
macro-expansion, hence evaluation of conditionals). The first number
must be followed by optional spaces and a character (of `\catcode` 12)
chosen among \<, =, \>. Examples.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \ifnum 0<1 \else\BUG\fi
    \ifnum 0=1 \BUG\fi
    \ifnum 0>1 \BUG\fi

    \ifnum 1\ifnum2>3 4\else6\fi\equalsign 14 \BUG \fi
:::

This is the transcript file for the last line. The difference between
the case `\else6 \fi` and `\else6\fi` is that the value of the first
number is known because of the space (first case) and equals sign
(second case).

\\ifodd {#cmd-ifodd}
-------

The `\ifodd` command is used to check whether a number is odd or even.
For instance `\ifodd12345` evaluates to true. See
[\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the case where the
test is true or false. The number is read by
[scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint) (scanning a number may involve
macro-expansion, hence evaluation of conditionals). Examples.

    \ifnum 4\ifodd1 2 \else 3\fi=42\else \BUG\fi
:::

\\\@ifstar {#cmd-ifstar}
----------

You can say `\@ifstar{yes-code}{no-code}`. The result depends on the
character that follows (spaces are ignored). If the character is a star,
it is read, and `yes-code` is executed. Otherwise the next character (or
token) is left unchanged, and `no-code` is executed. This command is
defined in LaTeX as `\def\@ifstar#1{\@ifnextchar *{\@firstoftwo{#1}}}`;
it is builtin in *Tralics*.

In the example that follows, we use the `` `\newif ``
\<doc-n.html\#cmd-newif\>[\_\_ command for setting a boolean. The code
should not signal an error. The token that follows
]{.title-ref}[test]{.title-ref}[ is not expanded. In the second case,
this token is ]{.title-ref}[ifok]{.title-ref}[, hence not a star. In the
last two lines, the ]{.title-ref}[expandafter]{.title-ref}[ has as
effect to replace the ]{.title-ref}[space]{.title-ref}[ by a space
character, so that this shows that spaces are effectively ignored by
]{.title-ref}[\@ifstar]{.title-ref}\`.

::: {.container .ltx-source}

    \expandafter\test\space\ifok\typeout{bug in ifstar4}\error\fi
:::

\\<if@tempswa> {#cmd-iftempswa}
--------------

Scratch condition. This is often set by LaTeX to check if some element
is in a list (note however that the `\in@` command that checks if a list
is a sublist of another one uses a different conditional, namely
`ifin@`).

ifthen (package) {#ifthenelse}
----------------

This defines essentially the `\ifthenelse` command.

\\ifthenelse {#cmd-ifthenelse}
------------

If you say `\ifthenelse{1<2}{right}{wrong}`, the result should be
\`right\'. More generally, the command takes an argument, evaluates it
as a boolean, and then reads two arguments and ignores one of them: if
the test is true, the third argument is ignored, if the test is false,
the second argument is ignored. (said otherwise, evaluating the test
might change catcodes, and arguments 2 and 3 are read only after the
test is complete).

Evaluation of the boolean value is similar to that of LaTeX. But some
details differ, for efficiency reasons.

-   In the test, tokens are considered, one after the other, without
    expansion. However, expansion takes place when `\ifnum` or `\ifdim`
    is called (equivalently, scanint, and scandimen).
-   In the case where the first token is `\not` or `\NOT`, the test is
    evaluated, and the value negated. In a case like the following,
    `\ifthenelse{\not 1<2 \or \NOT 3<4}{\bad}{ok}`, negation is applied
    before the `\or` token is evaluated. The result is the same as
    `\ifthenelse{1>2 \or  3>4}{\bad}{ok}`. It is the same as `ok`.
-   After the value of the test is found, the next token is considered
    (spaces are ignored). If this is `\and`, `\AND`, `\or`, `\OR` the
    following logic is applied. The expression `A \and B` is true if and
    only if both A and B are true. In the case where A is false, the
    result is false, no matter what B is, and B is not evaluated.
    Otherwise B is evaluated as a boolean. In the same fashion, in the
    case of `A \or B`, if A is true, the result is true, otherwise B is
    evaluated. Note that `\or` is a special command used by `\ifcase`,
    this explains why `\OR`, `\AND` and `\NOT` are introduced.
-   The test can be `\( A \and B \) \or \( C \and D \)`. In this case,
    when `\(` is seen, the test is evaluated, everything up to the
    matching `\)` is ignored. After that, evaluation continues as above.
-   Superfluous tokens are silently ignored, after the truth value of
    the test is found.
-   The test can be `\boolean{foo}`. The value will be true or false,
    depending on whether `\iffoo` is `\iftrue` or not (you should use
    `\setboolean {foo} {...}` for changing the boolean value of foo).
    See `` `\newboolean `` \<doc-n.html\#cmd-newboolean\>[\_\_ for an
    example. If the argument is randomly chosen, the result will be
    false. For instance ]{.title-ref}[boolean{odd}]{.title-ref}[ will be
    false (unless you redefine ]{.title-ref}[ifodd]{.title-ref}[), and
    ]{.title-ref}[boolean{true}]{.title-ref}\` will be true.
-   The test can be `\isundefined{\foo}`. The value is true if `\foo` is
    undefined. If the argument consists of more than one token, the
    first token is looked at. If the list is empty, the test is false.
    If the first token is not a command the test is false. (But you
    should use a single token).
-   The test can be `\isodd{...}`. A number is read via
    [scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint), and the test is true if the
    number is odd. Lamport says that `\isodd{\value{page}}` is
    syntactically correct, but provides the wrong answer (*Tralics*
    never modifies the page counter, so the test will always be true).
    In LaTeX, the `\value` command is redefined, so that it yields a
    list of tokens, these are put somewhere, read into `\count@`, and
    the value of `\count@` is checked via `\ifodd`. Strange.
-   The test can be `\equal{\foo}{bar}` Both arguments are put in a
    command and fully expanded. The resulting token lists are compared.
    Quoting Lamport: "If you\'re not sure exactly what equals what, try
    some experiments".
-   The test can be `\lengthtest{1pt < 2pt}` it is the same as `\ifdim`,
    two dimensions are read via [scandimen](doc-s.html#fct-scandimen)
    and compared. The test can be: less than, greater than, or equal to.
-   If the test does not start with one of the tokens listed above, it
    is the same as `\ifnum`, said otherwise, a number is read via
    [scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint), then a relation (less-than,
    greater-than or equal-to), then a second number. Both numbers are
    compared.

The command `\whiledo` uses `\ifthenelse` for its end test. Some
examples are given [here](doc-w.html#fct-whiledo)

We show here some use of `\boolean`, `\or` and `\and`.

\\iftrue {#cmd-iftrue}
--------

The `\iftrue` command is a test that is always true. See
[\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the case where the
test is true or false. See the TeXbook chapter 20 for usefulness of such
a command.

\\\@ifundefined {#cmd-ifundefined}
---------------

You can say `\@ifundefined{some-cmd-name}{undef-code}{def-code}`. In
this case, the character string \`some-cmd-name\' (the first argument of
the command) is converted to a command name, using `\csname`; all
commands in this string are expanded; if the resulting command is
undefined, `\relax` will be used instead; see `` `\csname ``
\<doc-c.html\#cmd-csname\>[\_\_ for details. If the result is undefined
(in reality ]{.title-ref}[relax]{.title-ref}\`) then the second argument
is executed, otherwise the third one is executed.

In the example that follows, we show how the `\setcounter` command is
implemented in LaTeX. Note that `\csname` is called twice: once to check
if the command is defined, and, in that case, again to executed it.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \newcounter{foo}
    \def\OO{oo}
    \setcounter{f\OO}{17}
    \def\setcounter#1#2{%

        {\@nocounterr{#1}}%
        {\global\csname c@#1\endcsname#2\relax}}
    \setcounter{f\OO}{18}
:::

This is the trace of *Tralics*. You can see that, by default, *Tralics*
does not call `\@ifundefined`, it checks however that the command is
associated to a counter register: in the case of
`\newdimen\c@foo\setcounter{foo}3`, *Tralics* generates the right error
message.

:::

\\ifvbox {#cmd-ifvbox}
--------

The command `\ifvbox` is a conditional; it reads a box number N, the
test is true if the box contains a vbox. In *Tralics*, N should be a
number between 0 and 1023. The test is always false (because box
registers contain XML elements, that are neither hbox nor vbox). See
[\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the case where the
test is true or false.

\\ifvmode {#cmd-ifvmode}
---------

This tests if the current mode is vertical mode. See
[\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what happens in the case where the
test is true or false. The internal state of TeX is given by an integer
between -3 and +3, they represent horizontal mode, (restricted
horizontal mode), vertical mode (internal vertical mode) or display math
mode (nondisplay math mode). There are three tests `\ifvmode`,
`\ihhmode` and `\ifmmode`. Internal vertical mode, restricted horizontal
mode and nondisplay math mode are called \`inner\', you can test then
with `\ifinner`. When you say `\write\chan{\foo}`, the token list `\foo`
is evaluated when the current pages is shipped out, and TeX is in
no-mode. Example.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \ifvmode 1 \else 2 \fi \ifinner 3\fi
    \vbox{\ifvmode 1 \else 2 \fi \ifinner 3\fi}
    \ifhmode 1 \else 2 \fi \ifinner 3\fi
    \hbox{\ifhmode 1 \else 2 \fi \ifinner 3\fi}
    \ifmmode 1 \else 2 \fi $\ifmmode 1 \else 2 \fi$
    $$\ifmmode 1 \else 2 \fi\ifinner 3\fi$$
:::

In the current implementation of *Tralics*, there is no difference
between `\hbox`, `\vbox` and `\xbox{}`. As a result, conditionals like
`\ifvmode` may give random results. The test `\ifinner` is always false
outside math mode (it should give the correct answer otherwise). The
test `\ifmmode` gives mostly the right answer.

\\ifvoid {#cmd-ifvoid}
--------

The command `\ifvoid` is a conditional; it reads a box number N, the
test is true if the box is void. In *Tralics*, N should be a number
between 0 and 1023. In the case `\setbox0=\xbox{foo}{}`, the box
contains an empty element but is not void. The constructions `\xbox{}{}`
and `\hbox{}` produce a void box. After an assignment of the form
`\setbox1\box0`, the box0 is empty. See [\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx)
for what happens in the case where the test is true or false.

\\ifx {#cmd-ifx}
-----

The `\ifx` command is used to compare two tokens. In a case like
`\ifx\foo\bar`, tokens `\foo` and `\bar` are not expanded, the result is
true if either the two tokens are not macros, and they both represent
the same sequence (character code, category code) pair, or the same
`\font` or `\chardef` or `\countdef\` etc, or the same primitive. In the
case where the tokens are macros (user defined), they compare equal if
they have the same status with respect to `\long` and `\outer` (this was
ignored by earlier versions of *Tralics*) and have the same code
(argument list and body). See [\\if\...](doc-i.html#cmd-ifxxx) for what
happens in the case where the test is true or false.

:::

If you say `\edef\fooA{\ifnum0=0\fi}` and `\def\fooB{\relax}`, these two
commands contain two different tokens that print the same and have the
same meaning. Example:

::: {.container .tty_out}
    \edef\fooA{\ifnum0=0\fi}
    \show\fooA
    \fooA=macro: ->\relax .
    \def\fooB{\relax}
    \show\fooB
    \fooB=macro: ->\relax .
    \ifx\fooA\fooB \else\typeout{different}\fi
    different
    \edef\test{\noexpand\ifx\fooA\fooB \typeout{same}\noexpand\fi}
    \show\test
    \test=macro: ->\ifx \relax \relax \typeout {same}\fi .
    \test
    same
:::

\\ignorespaces {#cmd-ignorespaces}
--------------

The `\ignorespaces` command expands the next token, and removes it, as
long as it is a space token. For instance, in
`a\ignorespaces\space \space b`, there are two spaces after the `\space`
command, these are ignored by the reader. On the other hand, the
`\space` command expands to a space, and this one is ignored. Thus, the
translation is the same as that of `ab`.

In the case of `a\ignorespaces{ } \space b`, there are two spaces not
removed by the reader: the spaces after the opening and closing braces.
Since the token that follows the `\ignorespaces` is the brace
(unexpandable), nothing happens, and the translation will contain three
spaces between the two letters a and b. Note: in general, three spaces
in the XML result cannot be distinguished from a single one.

\\iint, \\iiint, \\iiiint (math symbol) {#cmd-iint}
---------------------------------------

These are mathonly commands, producing double, triple and quadruple
integerals. See `` `\xiint `` \<doc-x.html\#cmd-xiint\>\`\_\_ for an
alternate command. Translation is a sequence of integral signs, with
some negative space between them.

\\ij (constant) {#cmd-ij}
---------------

The `\ij` command produces the ij ligature (Unicode U+133, Ä³). For
details see the [extended latin characters](doc-chars.html#ext-latin).

\\IJ (constant) {#cmd-cij}
---------------

The `\IJ` command produces the capital IJ ligature (Unicode U+132, Ä²).
For details see the [extended latin
characters](doc-chars.html#ext-latin).

\\Im (math symbol) {#cmd-Im}
------------------

The `\Im` command is valid only in math mode. It generates a
miscellaneous symbol: `<mi>&Im;</mi>` (Unicode U+2111, â). See
description of the `` `\ldots `` \<doc-l.html\#cmd-ldots\>\`\_\_
command.

imagesonly (environment from the html pk) {#env-imagesonly}
-----------------------------------------

The content of the environment is ignored.

\\ImaginaryI (math symbol) {#cmd-ImaginaryI}
--------------------------

The `\ImaginaryI` command is valid only in math mode. It generates a
miscellaneous symbol: `<mi>&ImaginaryI;</mi>` (Unicode U+2148, â).

\\imath (math symbol) {#cmd-imath}
---------------------

The `\imath` command is valid only in math mode. It generates a
miscellaneous symbol: `<mo>&imath;</mo>` (Unicode U+131, Ä±). See
description of the `` `\ldots `` \<doc-l.html\#cmd-ldots\>\`\_\_
command.

\\implies (math symbol) {#cmd-implies}
-----------------------

The `\implies` command is valid only in math mode. It generates
`<mo>&Rightarrow;</mo>` (Unicode U+21D2, â).

\\immediate {#cmd-immediate}
-----------

The `\immediate` command is a prefix for `\openout`, `\write`, or
`\closeout`; it is ignored otherwise. Without the prefix, the command is
executed when the box containing the command is shipped out. Since
`\shipout` is not implemented in *Tralics*, the three commands are
always executed immediately, so that `\immediate` does nothing.

\\in (math symbol) {#cmd-in}
------------------

The `\in` command is valid only in math mode. It generates a relation
symbol: `<mo>&Element;</mo>` (Unicode U+2208, â). See description of the
`` `\le `` \<doc-l.html\#cmd-le\>\`\_\_ command.

\\in@ {#cmd-inat}
-----

After evaluation of `\in@{L1}{L2}`, the conditional `\ifin@` is true if
the first argument L1 is a subsequence of the second argument L2., false
otherwise. The command could be defined as follows, except that `\FOO`
and `\BAR` are replaced by special tokens that cannot appear in normal
text.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \newif\ifin@
    \def\in@#1#2{%
     \def\in@@##1#1##2##3\BAR{%
      \ifx\FOO##2\in@false\else\in@true\fi}%
     \in@@#2#1\FOO\BAR}
:::

\\include {#cmd-include}
---------

Currently, there is no difference between `\include{file}` and
`\Input{file}`. See `` `\input `` \<doc-i.html\#cmd-input\>\`\_\_ for
details.

\\includeonly {#cmd-includeonly}
-------------

Since `\include` inputs its argument unconditionally, a call of the form
`\includeonly{file1,file2}` is ignored.

\\includegraphics {#cmd-includegraphics}
-----------------

The `\includegraphics` command takes an optional argument and a required
argument. The result is a `<figure>` element. There are some commands or
environments that behave differently if the argument or content is a
graphic file. Instead of `\includegraphics[xx]{yy}`, you can say
`\psfig{xx,file=yy}`.

Before version 2.13, *Tralics* made no difference between an image named
`foo.ps` and one named `foo.pdf`, the idea being that, if the XML is to
be converted to HTML, the images have to be converted also; hence the
extension has to be removed in any case. An error is signaled if the
file is named `foo.bar.gee` or something like that. Since version 2.13.3
you will see *Error: Wrong dots in graphic file foo.bar.gee*. This is
because *Tralics* calls the macro `\@filedoterr` with the file name as
argument. If such files are legal, it suffices to redefine to macro as
`\@gobble`. Example.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \framebox{\includegraphics{x.ps}}
    \fbox{\includegraphics{x.pdf}}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{x.gif}
    \scalebox{0.3}{\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{x.png}}
    \scalebox{0.3}{\includegraphics{./x.ps}}
    \includegraphics[angle=90]{x}
    \rotatebox{30}{\includegraphics{x}}
:::

The translation is:

::: {.container .xml_out}
    <figure framed='true' file='x' extension='ps'/>
    <figure framed='true' file='x' extension='pdf'/>
    <figure scale='0.3' file='x' extension='gif'/>
    <figure scale='0.3' file='x' extension='png'/>
    <figure scale='0.3' file='./x' extension='ps'/>
    <figure angle='90' file='x'/>
    <pic-rotatebox angle='30'><figure file='x'/></pic-rotatebox>
:::

The optional argument is a list of assignments. Since version 2.13.4,
all options defined by the standard graphicx package are recognized.
Moreover, keys can be preset via the `\setkeys` construct. The name can
be `clip`, `keepaspectratio`, `draft`, `hiresbb`; this is a boolean
value, anything but false means true (in particular if no value is
given). The name can be `type`, `read`, `angle`, `command`, `origin`,
`ext`, `scale`, case where any value is accepted. The name can be
`angle`. In this case, nothing is done if the value is zero.

The name can be `natwidth`, `natheight`, `bbllx`, `bblly`, `bburx`,
`bbury`, `bbury`, case where the value should a number with an optional
dimension (default is bp), it can be `bb`, `viewport`, `trim`, case
where the value should a list of four number with an optional dimension
(default is bp), separated by space.

The name can by `width`, `height`, `totalheight`, case where a dimension
is read (as the example shows, if the calc package is loaded, you can
use features of this package).

The name can be `file` or `figure` (but you give only one file name,
this is the required argument of `\includegraphics`, so that this
applies only to `\psfig`). As the example below shows, you can add
special characters like an underscore in the file name.

Example.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\myscale{.3}
    \includegraphics[height=15cm,width=\columnwidth]{A}
    \includegraphics[totalheight=18cm,width=\textheight-2cm]{AA}

:::

The names are not hard-coded. If the configuration file contains

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    att_scale = "Scale"
    att_file = "File"
    att_file_extension = "Extension"
    att_angle = "Angle"
    att_width = "Width"
    att_height = "Height"
    att_clip = "Clip"
    xml_figure_name = "Figure"
:::

then the translation may be

::: {.container .xml_out}
    <Figure Height='6.cm' Width='7.5cm' Angle='20' Clip='true' Scale='2'
       File='Logo' Extension='ps'/>
:::

If you compile the file foo, then *Tralics* will generate a file named
foo.img that contains the following.

::: {.container .log_out}
    # images info, 1=ps, 2=eps, 4=epsi, 8=epsf, 16=pdf, 32=png, 64=gif
    see_image("Logo",1+16,3);
    see_image("../../a_b:c",0,1);
    see_image("x_",0,1);
    see_image("x",0,6);
:::

This has to be interpreted as follows: the logo was included 3 times, it
exists with extension \`ps\' and \`pdf\', the other images were not
found (extensions ps, eps, epsi, epsf, pdf, png and gif were tried).
Image x was included six times. Note the following trick: if the image
is `./x.ps`, you will see `x` in the img file; since version 2.13.2, you
will see `file='./x' extension='ps'` in the XML file.

\\indent {#cmd-indent}
--------

The `\indent` command creates an indented paragraph. See description of
the `` `\noindent `` \<doc-n.html\#cmd-noindent\>\`\_\_ command.

\\index, \\glossary {#cmd-index}
-------------------

You can say `\index{A!B!C}`, this produces a subsub item in a subitem of
an item in the index. Each of A, B, C can be of the form `foo`,
`foo@bar`, `foo|gee`, or `foo@bar|gee`. There are four special
characters (exclamation point, at-sign, vertical bar, and double quote;
there meaning is normal when preceded by a double quote. *Tralics* fully
expands everything (if you use LaTeX and makeindex, there is a
possibility to delay expansion after processing by makeindex; the
situation is simpler in *Tralics*. A non-obvious point is to put a hat
in the index at the right position.

In the case of `foo@bar|gee`, the index will contain \'bar\', and
makeindex will apply the command `\gee` to the page of the reference.
The *Tralics* translation is a `<index>` element, with a `target`
attribute, whose value is the list of the IDs of the anchors. We could
add an attribute `encap`, with as value the list of all these \'gee\';
this is not yet done, and the page encapsulation is silently discarded.
The string \'foo\' will be used as sort key. In the case of `xfoo@bar`
and `yfoo@bar`, we consider this as the same entry, with different keys;
makeindex may disagree. Example

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    OK
    \index{verb}a
    \index{vÃ©rb}b
    \index{verb@verb}c
    \index{vÃ©rb@verb}d
    \index{vÃ©rb@vÃ©rb}e
    \index{vÃ©rb@vÃ©rb|bf}f
    \index{vÃ©rb!vÃ¨rb}g
    \index{vÃ©rb!vÃ¨rb}h
    OK
:::

The translation may be the following, some further explanations will be
given below.

    <anchor id='uid2'/>b
    <anchor id='uid3'/>c

    </theindex>
:::

*Tralics* implements some features of the index package. The command
`\newindex` takes an optional argument A, an optional star, a unique tag
B, two arguments C, D and a last argument E. You should refer to the
documentation of the package for explanations of A, C, D, and the star.
It calls `\@newindex` with arguments B and E. The main index has tag
`default`, the glossary has tag `glossary`, with titles `Index` and
`Glossary`. Nothing happens if you try to redefine an existing index;
the main index will be used if you try to use an undeclared index. In
the example below, we define two indexes, A and B, but use only A.

The `\index` command takes an optional star (ignored) and an optional
argument, which is the tag of an index. There is no difference between
`\glossary{foo}` and `\index[glossary]{foo}`; In the same fashion
`\index{foo}` is the same as `\index[default]{foo}`. The command
`\addattributetoindex` takes three arguments (the first one being
optional, and specifying an index). It adds an attribute pair to the
index. The `title` attribute of an index is the title described above
(`Index` for the main index), but you can overwrite it using this
command. For instance, we redefine the title of the glossary an the main
index.

The commands `\makeindex` and `\makeglossary` have no effect. The
commands `\printindex` and `\printglossary` can be used to say where the
index is to be put. By default the end of the document is considered,
and the glossary is put after all other indexes. Example.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \newindex{A}{}{}{Second Index}
    \newindex{B}{}{}{Third index}
    \addattributetoindex{title}{First Index}
    \addattributetoindex[A]{head}{Second Index}
    \addattributetoindex[glossary]{title}{A Glossary}
    These words are in the glossary
    \glossary{G1}1\glossary{G2}2
    \glossary{G1}3\index[glossary]{G2}4
    These are in the second index
    \index[A]{G1}1\index[A]{G2}2
    \index[A]{G1}3\index[A]{G2!G3}4

\\interfootnotelinepenalty (count register) {#cmd-interfootnotelinepenalty}
-------------------------------------------

Penalty used used a linebreak occurs between two footnotes; unused by
*Tralics*.

\\interdisplaylinepenalty (count register) {#cmd-interdisplaylinepenalty}
------------------------------------------

Penalty used used a linebreak occurs between two lines in an equation;
unused by *Tralics*.

\\inf (math symbol) {#cmd-inf}
-------------------

The `\inf` command is valid only in math mode. Its translation is a math
operator of the same name:
`<mo form='prefix' movablelimits='true'>inf</mo>`. For an example see
the `` `\log `` \<doc-l.html\#cmd-log\>\`\_\_ command.

\\infty (constant) {#cmd-infty}
------------------

The `\infty` command is valid only in math mode. It generates a
miscellaneous symbol: `<mi>&infty;</mi>` (Unicode U+221E, â). See
description of the `` `\ldots `` \<doc-l.html\#cmd-ldots\>\`\_\_
command.

\\injlim (constant) {#cmd-injlim}
-------------------

The `\injlim` command is valid only in math mode. Its translation is a
math operator of the same name
`<mo form='prefix' movablelimits='true>inj lim</mo>`. For an example see
the `` `\log `` \<doc-l.html\#cmd-log\>\`\_\_ command.

\\inplus (math symbol) {#cmd-inplus}
----------------------

The `\inplus` command is valid only in math mode. It generates
`<mo>&loplus;</mo>` (Unicode U+2A2D, â¨­).

\\input, \\Input {#cmd-input}
----------------

The `\input` command takes one argument, a file name, and opens the
file, exactly like `\InputIfFileExists` described below. An error is
signaled if the file does not exists.

There is an alternate syntax, without braces. The name of the file is
obtained by expanding tokens, and looking for characters. Letters and
underscore characters (of catcode 8) are allowed. A space terminates
parsing. Other characters terminate also, but they are pushed back, to
be read again. You can say for instance:
`\input taux1.tex\input taux2.tex`

You can say `\Input{foo}` or `\include{foo}`, the behavior is the same,
but the braces are required. You can put a star after the command name,
as a side effect, the at-sign @ character becomes a letter while reading
the file (and its category code is restored at the end). The same holds
for `\InputIfFileExists`.

\\<input@encoding>, \\<input@encoding@default>, \\<input@encoding@val> {#cmd-input-encoding}
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Variables that holds input encoding method. There are 34 (maybe more)
input methods. Method 0 is UTF8, method 1 is latin1, these cannot be
changed. All other methods define a translation table. If you say
`\input@encoding@val   4 5 6`, this changes the value for encoding 4 of
the character 5 to be 6. The first number must be between 2 and the size
of the table; the second number must be a integer between 0 and 255, the
last number should be between 0 and maxchar (less than 2\^16). If you
say `\the\input@encoding@val 4   5` this gives the value of encoding 4,
character 5. The two commands `\input@encoding` and
`input@encoding@default` are reference to the current or default
encoding. Thus `\input@encoding=3` is a declaration to use encoding 3,
and `\theinput@encoding=3` typesets the current encoding. Each file has
its own encoding. The default encoding is used when the file is opened.
A command line parameter lets you select between encoding 0 and 1. If
the file contains, on the first line "iso-8859-1" or "utf8-encoded"
(without the quotes), and somewhere near the beginning "%&TEX encoding =
UTF-8", then utf8 or latin1 is selected. \[Note: recommended syntax is
"coding: utf-8"\]. If your document is encoded in latin9, then you
should use the inputenc package, that defines an encoding number (for
instance 3), defines the encoding, changes the default encoding, and
that of the calling file.

\\InputClass (Tralics extension) {#cmd-InputClass}
--------------------------------

You can use commands like `\DeclareOption`, this adds an option to the
current class or package, and the command has no effect outside a class
or package. If you say `\InputClass{foo}`, *Tralics* will input the file
foo.clt, and the content is considered to be part of the current class
file.

\\InputIfFileExists {#cmd-inputiffileexists}
-------------------

The `\InputIfFileExists` command takes three arguments, say A, B, C. The
behavior is like `\IfFileExists{A}{B\Input{A}}{C}`, see
`` `\IfFileExists `` \<doc-i.html\#cmd-iffileexists\>[\_\_, for how
existence of the file A with possible extension is checked. If you put a
star after the command, it will be transmitted to
]{.title-ref}[Input]{.title-ref}\`. This will have as a consequence that
the character \'@\' is a letter while reading the content of the file.
You can also put a plus sign after the optional star, this means that
the file is not searched in the input directory stack.

The procedure is a bit optimized: first all arguments are read; then the
existence of the file is checked. If the file does exist, it is opened;
this has as consequence that all unread characters on the current line
are saved on a special stack, they will be read again at the end of the
current file. Then one of the token lists B or C is inserted into the
list of unread tokens. If the star form is used, the category code of
the at-sign character is changed, its old value is saved on the special
stack mentioned above.

Let\'s assume that no file named nohope exists, but the file taux2.tex
contains the following lines.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
:

    % aux file  for testing tralics
    % this file contains nothing useful
    \mytypeout{in file taux2.tex}
    \endinput
    The file should finish with a \endinput, but not on the last line. 
:::

It is possible to generate this file using the following code

The following piece of code defines macros `\foo`, `\bad`, etc, in such

\\inputlineno (restricted integer) {#cmd-inputlineno}
----------------------------------

You can say `\inputlineno=37`, this attempts to put the integer 37 in a
read-only variable. (See [scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint) for details
of argument scanning). The variable contains the current input line
number.

\\insert {#cmd-insert}
--------

You can say something like `\insert200 \relax{\bf a}`. What happens is
explained at the end of Chapter 15 of the [TeXbook](index.html#texbook),
see [here](doc-un.html#cmd-insert2) for details). Essentially, this is
used to implement footnotes, hence depends on how TeX makes pages from
lines of input. Thus, this command is not implemented in *Tralics*.
However, if you say `\insert2000 \bf`, you will get three errors: a
first that says that `\insert` is unimplemented, a second that says that
the number is out of range and a third that says that an opening brace
was missing (but no brace is inserted).

\\insertbibliohere (Tralics command) {#cmd-insertbibliohere}
------------------------------------

This command defines a location in the XML tree where *Tralics* will
insert the bibliography. For details see section [2.8
Bibliography](raweb.html#rabib) of the raweb documentation.

\\insertpenalties {#cmd-insertpenalties}
-----------------

When TeX computes the cost of a pagebreak, it takes the sum of the
penalty of the current breakpoint and `\insertpenalties`. This is the
accumulated penalty for split insertions.

The number of insertions not handled is in `\insertpenalties` while an
`\output` routine is active.

In *Tralics*, you can assign any value to `\insertpenalties`, nothing
happens. You can consult the value, you will always see zero.

\\int (math symbol) {#cmd-int}
-------------------

The `\int` command is valid only in math mode. Its translation is a
variable-sized symbol: `<mo>&int;</mo>` (Unicode U+222B, â«). For an
example see the `` `\sum `` \<doc-s.html\#cmd-sum\>\`\_\_ command.

\\interactionmode (restricted integer) {#cmd-interactionmode}
--------------------------------------

You can say `\interactionmode=37`, this is an extension defined by
Îµ-TeX. (See [scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint) for details of argument
scanning). The `\interactionmode` command allows you to get or set the
current interaction mode, an integer between 0 and 3. Setting it is
no-op in *Tralics* (no error signaled), the value is always zero (this
is batchmode in TeX, which is more or less the only mode of interaction
of *Tralics*).

\\intercal (math symbol) {#cmd-intercal}
------------------------

The `\intercal` command is valid only in math mode. Its translation is
`<mo>&intercal;</mo>` (Unicode U+22BA, âº).

\\interleave (math symbol) {#cmd-interleave}
--------------------------

The `\interleave` command is valid only in math mode. Its translation is
`<mo>&#x2AF4;</mo>` (Unicode U+2AF4, â«´).

\\interlinepenalties (internal integer) {#cmd-interlinepenalties}
---------------------------------------

This is an extension defined by Îµ-TeX. See `` `\widowpenalties ``
\<doc-w.html\#cmd-widowpenalties\>\`\_\_ for syntax and usage.

\\interlinepenalty (internal integer) {#cmd-interlinepenalty}
-------------------------------------

When you say `\interlinepenalty=95`, then TeX will use 95 as penalty for
a page break between two lines of text. Unused by *Tralics*. (See
[scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint) for details of argument scanning).

\\intertext {#cmd-intertext}
-----------

The expression `\intertext{foo}` is the same as
`\multicolumn{2}{l}{\mbox{foo}}\\`. This must be used inside a table or
array, for instance the align environment. Typical use is LaTeX
companion example 8-2-21.

\\intextsep (rubber length) {#cmd-intextsep}
---------------------------

There are a great number of parameters used by LaTeX to control float
placement; they are all unused by *Tralics*. There are five rubber
length parameters, `\intextsep` controls the space between a float and
the texts in the non-floating case, `\floatsep` controls the space
between two floats, `\textfloatsep` controls the space between a float
and surrounding text, `\dblfloatsep` and `\dbltextfloatsep` are
analogous quantities for floats that span more than one column. There
are four counters, `topnumber` (maximal number of floats on top of a
page), `bottomnumber` (maximal number of floats on bottom of a page),
`dbltopnumber` (maximal number of multicolumn floats on top of a page),
and `totalnumber` (maximal number of floats on a page). There are six
real numbers, `\topfraction`, `\bottomfraction`, `\textfraction`,
`\floatpagefraction`, `\dbltopfraction` and `\dblfloatpagefraction`. If
`\topfraction` is 0.75, this means that a page formed of floats (on the
top) followed by text cannot contain more than 75% of floats. Same for
`\bottomfraction` and `\dblfloatpagefraction`. Other parameters define
the minimum quantity of text or float that can appear on a page.

\\InvisibleComma (math symbol) {#cmd-InvisibleComma}
------------------------------

The `\InvisibleComma` command is valid only in math mode. It generates
the invisible operator `<mo>&InvisibleComma;</mo>` (Unicode U+2063, â£).

\\InvisibleTimes (math symbol) {#cmd-InvisibleTimes}
------------------------------

The `\InvisibleTimes` command is valid only in math mode. It generates
the invisible operator `<mo>&InvisibleTimes;</mo>` (Unicode U+2062, â¢).

\\iota (math symbol) {#cmd-iota}
--------------------

The `\iota` command is valid only in math mode. It generates a Greek
letter: `<mi>&iota;</mi>` (Unicode U+3B9, Î¹). See description of the
`` `\alpha `` \<doc-a.html\#cmd-alpha\>\`\_\_ command.

\\isodd {#cmd-isodd}
-------

You can say `\isodd{25}` in order to check that 25 is an odd number
inside `\ifthenelse`. You could also use `\ifodd 25 ...\fi`. See
`` `\ifthenelse `` \<doc-i.html\#cmd-ifthenelse\>\`\_\_ for details.

\\isundefined {#cmd-isundefined}
-------------

The standard way to check that a command is undefined is to compare it
(with `\ifx`) to an undefined command (and hope that nobody has defined
it). Inside `\ifthenelse`, you can say `\isundefined{\foo}`, and the
effect is the same, see `` `\ifthenelse ``
\<doc-i.html\#cmd-ifthenelse\>[\_\_ for details. You can also say
]{.title-ref}[\@ifundefind{foo}{\...}{\...}]{.title-ref}[ (see
]{.title-ref}`\@ifundefined` \<doc-i.html\#cmd-ifundefined\>\`\_\_)

\\it {#cmd-it}
----

The `\it` command is equivalent to `\normalfont\itshape`. In other
words, it selects a font of roman family, medium series and italic
shape. For an example of fonts, see `` `\rm ``
\<doc-r.html\#cmd-rm\>\`\_\_.

\\item {#cmd-item}
------

The `\item` command creates an item in a list. It takes an optional
argument, that is the label of the item, which is evaluated inside a
group. See also `` `\@item `` \<\#cmd-at-item\>[\_\_ and
]{.title-ref}`\@itemlabel` \<\#cmd-at-itemlabel\>\`\_\_. Here is an
example of three types of lists.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \begin{itemize}
     \item[first item] This is the first item
     \item[\it second item] This is the second item
     \item[third] This is the last item
     \begin{description}
      \item[a] description of a.
      \item[b] description of b.
      \item[cde] description of cde.
      \item[defgh etc] description of other letters
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item One
        \item Two
        \item Threee
      \end{enumerate}
     \end{description}
    \end{itemize}
:::

This is the translation of the example above. Note that each item
contains one or more paragraphs, and that each item has a unique id, and
a id-text. If the local list counter is `enumi`, the id-text is the
value of `\theenumi` after incrementing the counter. See
[enumi](doc-e.html#cmd-enumi) for additional explanations (in the
example above, three counters are used, `Enumi`, `Enumii` and `enumi`).
In the case of a description, the macro `\labelenumi` (the name depends
on the enumeration level) is used to produce the `label` attribute. Each
item with an optional argument has a label. How it is typeset depends on
the style sheet (in the preview below, labels in an enumeration are
flushed right, except if too big).

          <item id-text='3.3' id='uid6'><p noindent='true'>description of cde.</p></item>
          <label>defgh etc</label>
          <item id-text='3.4' id='uid7'><p noindent='true'>description of other letters</p>

\\\@item, \\@\@item (Tralics command) {#cmd-at-item}
-------------------------------------

The `\item` command is normally bound to `\@@item` but can be changed to
`\@item`, either by using `\let` in the tex file or
alternate_item=\"true\" in the configuration file. The difference lies
in the translation of the optional argument

The default rule is: an optional argument to the `\item` command
produces a `<label>` element, and in a list, you should either use no
optional argument, or provide an optional argument for every item. If
you change `\item` to `\@item`, this gives the following behavior: an
optional argument produces a `label` attribute, and translation of
`\item` is always a single element. This forbids using math formulas in
the optional argument (for instance `\item[$\bullet$]` won\'t work).

A rule of thumb is: optional arguments are useless for `itemize`,
mandatory for `description`, and automatic for `enumerate`. Here
automatic means: the labels a, b, c may be computed by *Tralics*, the
XML to HTML converter, or the web browser, or whatever. These labels
were not computed by early versions of *Tralics*. In the current
version, in the case of `description`, the label is computed (unless
explicitly given), and produces an attribute (this means that using
`\fnsymbol` for producing the label will produce an error, since it
generates math expressions). The command `\enumi@hook` (its name depends
on the enumeration level) is executed (if defined) at the start of the
environment. In the example that follows it adds an attribute to the
current element (the list). Note that the hook is executed after
`\@itemlabel` has been redefined to `\theenumi`, it can locally redefine
this variable.

\\\@itemlabel {#cmd-at-itemlabel}
-------------

The value of this command is set by list environments. In the case of
enumeration it is `\labelenumXXX` (where XXX is the lowercase roman
letter value of the list depth). In the case of other standard lists,
the value is `\relax`. In the case of `list`, it is a macro without
arguments that contains the value of the first argument of the
environment. The `\item` command takes an optional argument; if omitted,
the value of `\@itemlabel` is used, provided this is not `\relax`.

\\itemindent (rigid length) {#cmd-itemindent}
---------------------------

This holds a dimension (indentation of the first line of an item). Not
used by *Tralics*.

itemize (environment) {#env-itemize}
---------------------

This is an environment in which you can put items. See description of
`` `\item `` \<doc-i.html\#cmd-item\>\`\_\_ above.

\\itemsep (rubber length) {#cmd-itemsep}
-------------------------

This holds a length (amount of extra vertical space, in addition to
`\parsep`, inserted between successive list items. Not used by
*Tralics*.

\\itshape {#cmd-itshape}
---------

The `\itshape` command changes the shape of the current font to an
italic shape. For an example of fonts, see `` `\rm ``
\<doc-r.html\#cmd-rm\>\`\_\_.

\\\@iwhiledim \\\@iwhilenum \\\@iwhilesw {#cmd-iwhiledim}
----------------------------------------

Private commands used by `` `\@whiledim ``

\\\@ixpt {#cmd-ixpt}
--------

The expansion of the `\@ixpt` is 9.
