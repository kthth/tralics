------------------------------------------------------------------------

abstract (environment)
----------------------

The `abstract` environment is not implemented in Tralics. (this
environment is not defined by LaTeX, but by classes like article and
report). However, it is possible to define one that can be used once for
a titlepage. See [Configuration page](titlepage.html).

\\accent
--------

This command is followed by a 8-bit number and by optional assignments.
"Here optional assignments stands for zero or more assignment commands
other than `\setbox`. If the assignments are not followed by a
character, where character stands for any of the commands just discussed
in the previous paragraph, TeX treats `\accent` as if it were `\char`,
except that the space factor is set to 1000. Otherwise, the character
that follows the assignment is accented by the character that
corresponds to the 8-bit number (The purpose of the intervening
assignments is to allow the accenter and the accentee to be in different
fonts.) \[\...\] Finally TeX sets `\spacefactor=10000`." So, according
to the TeXbook, the following is legal:
`` \\accent`a\count0=0\par \accent'23\count0=0e ``. It produces an
\`a\', then a \`Ã©\' (provided that the current font uses the
OT1-encoding). In *Tralics* an error is generated and the behavior is
that of like `\char`. The space factor is left unchanged. See
[scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint) for how the argument is scanned.

\\addcontentsline
-----------------

This command is defined by LaTeX as
`\def\addcontentsline#1#2#3{%   \addtocontents{#1}{\protect\contentsline{#2}{#3}{\thepage}}}`
The first argument is the name of a file extension (toc, lof or lot),
the second a symbolic name (for instance, it could be `part`, in this
case `\protect \contentsline{#2}` will evaluate later to `\l@part`); the
last argument will in general be a command (like `\numberline`) that
does something with the line number.

In *Tralics*, the value of `\thepage` is undefined, this explains why
this command is not implemented.

\\address
---------

This command is not defined by LaTeX, but by classes like letter, and
maybe some classes for articles to journals. However, it is possible to
define such a command that can be used once for a titlepage. See
[Configuration page](titlepage.html).

\\addtocontents
---------------

See `\addcontentsline` above. This command takes two arguments, and
prints in a file defined by the first argument, the value of the second.
This value is expanded, except for: `\label`, \\`\index`, `\glossary`
(these commands and their arguments are not written), commands preceeded
by `\protect`, and `\thepage` (this command is expanded later, when the
page is shipped out).

\\addvspace
-----------

Unimplemented. See elsewhere.

\\appendix
----------

Lamport says that: `\appendix` is a declaration that changes the way
sectional units are numbered. It generates no text, and does not affect
the numbering of parts. Since *Tralics* does not handle section numbers,
this command does nothing really useful.

You may consider: `\endsec{}\xmlemptyelt{appendix}`, this closes all
sectioning environments and puts `<appendix>` on the top of the XML
tree.

\\arraystretch
--------------

\\author
--------

In LaTeX, this command remember its argument in `\@author`, and the
class may (or may not) use its value via `\maketitle`; it may also make
it undefined later on.

It is not implemented in *Tralics*, but you can design your own
titlepage format. See [Configuration page](titlepage.html).

\\displaylines {#cmd-displaylines}
--------------

This command is defined in TeX (and LaTeX for compatibility). It
corresponds to the LaTeX environments `multline` or `gather`. You say
for instance `$$\displaylines{line1\cr\line2\cr  ... last line\cr}$$`
Each line is centered (but you can use `\hfill`). Exercise 19.16 of the
TeXbook explains how you can fake equation numbers. Unimplemented

\\eqalign {#cmd-eqalign}
---------

This is a plain TeX construction. A typical example is
`$$\eqalign{line&1\cr\line&2\cr    last& line\cr}$$`. Its LaTeX
equivalent would be
`\begin{align*}line&1\\line&2\\    last& line\end{align*}`. The
`\eqalign` construction is allowed anywhere in a display math
environment and corresponds to a `aligned` environment in LaTex; see
example below.

\\eqalignno, \\leqalignno {#cmd-eqalignno}
-------------------------

These are plain TeX constructions. A typical example is
`$$\eqalignno{line&1\cr\line&2&(a)\cr    last& line&b\cr}$$`. The effect
is the same as `\eqalign`, as described above, but the second and third
equations have an equation number on the right. In the case of
`\leqalignno`, it would be on the left. The equation number may overlap
the formula. If a formula contains `\eqalignno` it should contain
nothing else. You can use `\noalign{\hbox{and}}` to separate equations
with text; the LaTeX equivalent of this construction being `\intertext`.
The LaTeX philosophy is to use automatic equation numbers, so that this
construction becomes less interesting, however the `\tag` command can be
used to change the equation number. Moreover, a global indicator says
that all equation numbers are to be put on the left (or right).

Example. If you say `\tagasattribute` then *Tralics* will put the tags
as attribute for the formula. Since there is one equation, what you get
is a single attribute containing `a,b`. Note that the use of `\tag*`
inhibits putting parentheses around the tag. There is a third option,
`\tagatcurpos` that puts the tag at the current position (with some
space on the left). In this case, parentheses around tags are correct.

\\futurenonspacelet {#cmd-futurenonspacelet}
-------------------

This macro is explained in the TeXbook, appendix D; it is provided by
the booktabs package.

\\insert {#cmd-insert2}
--------

This command scan a 8-bit integer; it must not be 255 (as this is a
register index, any value less than 1024 is allowed by *Tralics*). After
that comes filler, then a {, then vertical mode material and finally }
(see [scantoks](doc-s.html#fct-scantoks) for the syntax). "The { causes
TeX to enter internal vertical mode and a new level of grouping. When
the matching } is sensed, the vertical list is put into an insertion
item that is appended to the current list using \[\...\] that were
current in the group just ended. This insertion item leads ultimately to
a page insertion only if it appears in TeX\'s main vertical list, so it
will have to 'migrate' there if it starts out in a horizontal list or a
math list. TeX also exercises the page builder, after an `\insert` has
been appended in vertical mode". (Citation from the
[TeXbook](index.html#texbook), Chapter 24).

The insertion item is formed of the list constructed above, and some
parameters, stored in registers indexed by the 8-bit integer. What
happens with the content of the box is complicated (the previous
paragraphs indicated that it could simply disappear). In fact, this is
used to implement footnotes in plain TeX, and floating figures in LaTeX
(each pending float uses a different insertion number).

\\newfam \\<new@mathgroup> {#newfam}
--------------------------

The command `\newfam\x` allocates a new counter for use with `\fam`.
Since math families are not implemented, the allocator is not
implemented either in *Tralics*. In LaTeX, a family is a `\mathgroup`
and the allocator is `\new@mathgroup`.

\\newinsert
-----------

The command `\newinsert\x` allocates a new slot for use with `\insert`;
if the allocated value is for instance 17, then `\count17`, `\dimen17`,
`\skip17` and `\box17` are reserved for this insertion. Since insertions
are not implemented, the allocator is not implemented either in
*Tralics*.

\\newhelp
---------

The result of `\newhelp\foo{my message}` is to allocate a new token list
register, say 12, make `\foo` equivalent to `\toks12` and put in this
token register the command whose name is `my message`. You can say
`\errhelp=\foo` since `\foo` has the right type. In case of error, the
token register is printed. According to Knuth this saves space (well, in
some sense). Unimplemented.

\\openup {#cmd-openup}
--------

In plain TeX, `\displaylines` and similar commands start with
`\openup1\jot`. This puts some extra space between the formula and the
text that precedes.

\\vadjust {#cmd-vadjust2}
---------

This command is similar to `` `\insert `` \<\#cmd-insert\>[\_\_ (except
that it does not read an insertion number). "The constructed vertical
list goes into an adjustment item that is appended to the current list.
However, ]{.title-ref}[vadjust]{.title-ref}[ is not allowed in vertical
mode. When an adjustment item migrates from a horizontal list to the
vertical list, the vertical list inside the adjustment item is
'unwrapped' and put directly into the enclosing list" (Citation from the
\`TeXbook \<index.html\#texbook\>]{.title-ref}\_\_, Chapter 24).

In *Tralics*, there is no conversion from an horizontal list into a
vertical list, so that this command provokes an error. Note that second
error may occur while scanning the brace. (see
[scantoks](doc-s.html#fct-scantoks) for the syntax).
