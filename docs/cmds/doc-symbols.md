------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following definitions will be used here:

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\testeq#1#2{\def\tmp{#2}\ifx#1\tmp\else \toks0={#1wantd: ->#2.}
    \typeout{\the\toks0}\show #1\uerror\fi}
    \def\xtesteq#1#2{\xdef\tmp{#2}\ifx#1\tmp\else \toks0={#1wantd: ->}
    \typeout{\the\toks0 #2.}\show #1\uerror\fi}
:::

This can be used as

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\foo{something} \testeq\foo{Something else}
:::

and will produce no XML, but an error and two lines of message, like

::: {.container .tty_out}
    \foo wantd: ->Something else.
    \foo=macro: ->something.
    Error signaled at line 352:
    Undefined command \uerror.
:::

Note the following points. Both `\typeout` and `\show` print the value
on the tty as well as the transcript file. The token list of `\typeout`
is fully expanded, and for this reason, we put in a token list the
quantity `#1wantd: ->#2.` and inhibit expansion via `\the`.

The symbols, by catcode
-----------------------

Unless stated otherwise, a category code (in short a catcode) is an
integer between 0 and 15. It is a property of input characters, used by
the scanner to convert the input stream into a sequence of tokens. The
character with ASCII code 37 is the character %, and is normally of
category 14, thus behaves like a start-of-comment. You can insert such a
character in the XML output via the sequence `\char37` (However
`\char60` produces `&lt;`, see the `` `\char ``
\<doc-c.html\#cmd-char\>\`\_\_ command). In most of the cases, a
character of catcode *c* is read as a command with command code *c*.

*Tralics* uses the same parsing rules as TeX, with the exception of
characters of category 16 (see below), and the fact that the character
range is not limited to 8bit characters but to 16 bits. A construction
like `^^^^^1d7e0` provides a character without category code, see [the
documentation on characters](doc-chars.html).

### Catcode 0

The only character with catcode 0 is the backslash. This character is
used to construct command names. The number 0 is not a command code. The
command name is created as follows: if the next character is not of
category 11, the name consists of the single character, and *Tralics*
goes into state *S* if the character is a space, state *M* otherwise; if
the character is of category 11, the name consists of all characters
category 11 starting with the current one, and *Tralics* goes into state
*S*. The first unused character will be read again later, and a category
code assigned to it. Normally, spaces after command names are ignored
because the current state *S* and the category code of the space
character is 10. But the command can change the category code of the
character that follows.

The following example shows how to change the `\catcode` of the letter
x, so that x can be used like a backslash. In the second definition,
there is no space between the digit zero and the letter x. This letter
is scanned, found to be a non digit, and pushed back in the main token
list; at this moment, the catcode is still unchanged, `xfoo` is
considered as a string of four letters, and not a command.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    {\def\foo{\gdef\bar{OK}}  \catcode`x=0 xfoo}
    \testeq\bar{OK}
    {\def\foo{\gdef\bar{notOK}}  \catcode`x=0xfoo}
    \testeq\bar{OK}
:::

The next example shows that the token after a control sequence like
`\foo` can be of catcode letter (because when the character is read
again, its catcode is analysed again).

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    {\def\bar#1{\egroup\show#1}
    \def\foo{\bgroup\catcode32=11\catcode`\%=11 \bar}\foo \foo%\foo=\foo$\foo#}
:::

In the *Tralics* output below, \`the letter\' means a character of
category 11, \`the character\' a character of category 12.

::: {.container .tty_out}
    the letter  .
    the letter %.
    the character =.
    math shift character $.
    macro parameter character #.
:::

### Catcode 1

Initially, the only character of catcode 1 is the open brace. See below.

### Catcode 2

Initially, the only character of catcode 2 is the closing brace.

The following example shows that you can use other characters. In
*Tralics*, characters of catcode 1 and 2 serve two purposes: for
grouping, so that modifications are local to a group, and for delimiting
arguments.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    {\catcode`A1\catcode`B2 
    \def\fooA2B\testeq\fooA2B
    \def\barA\bgroup\def\fooA3B\egroupB\bar% \bar modifies \foo locally
    \testeq\foo{2}}
:::

Note the following trick: `\uppercase \relax\bgroup}`. After
`\uppercase` and commands like that, you can have an arbitrary sequence
of spaces and `\relax` commands. The argument is delimited on the left
by an implicit left brace, on the right by an explicit right brace.

### Catcode 3

Initially, the only character with catcode 3 is the dollar sign. It is
used to enter and exit math and display math mode. A construct like
`` {\catcode `x=3 \catcode`y=3 xy \sinxy} `` is the same as `\[\sin\]`.

### Catcode 4

The only character with catcode 4 is the alignment tab character &. (see
description of [arrays](doc-array.html)).

### Catcode 5

The only character with catcode 5 is the end-of-line character (carriage
return, ASCII code 13). When TeX sees such a character, it throws away
the remaining of the line. If TeX is in state *N*, the result is a
`\par` token; if TeX is in state *M*, the result is a newline token of
catcode 10, and otherwise, the character is ignored. For *Tralics*, the
newline token has value 10 (line-feed), and not 32 (space) as in TeX. As
a result, in most cases, newline characters remain in the XML result,
whenever they are equivalent to space (the purpose is to make the output
more readable). Note that *Tralics* is in state *N* whenever it reads
the first character of a line. The number 5 is not a command code.

Whenever *Tralics* sees a new line, it inserts the character defined by
the `\endlinechar` command. This character is by default the end of line
character, see `` `\endlinechar ``
\<doc-e.html\#cmd-endlinechar\>\`\_\_.

### Catcode 6

The only character with catcode 6 is the sharp sign \#. This character
is used as parameter delimiter or parameter reference in macro
definitions. It is also used in TeX table preambles (but not in LaTeX
not *Tralics*). In the definition of `\xbar` below, the quantity `#1`
refers to the first argument of `\Ma`, `##1` refers to the first
argument of `\Mb` and `####1` could be used to refer to the first
argument of `\xbar`. As you can see, the sharp character can be replaced
by any character of catcode 6. In order to put in a command a character
of category code 6, it suffices to precede it by any character of
catcode 6. The body of the `\xfoo` command is `#A#A`, but the printer
shows it as `##AA##AA`. Example

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    {\catcode`A6 \def\fooA1A2{\xdef\bar{A2A1}}\foo23
    \testeq\bar{32}}
    \def\Ma#1{\def\Mb ##1{\xdef\xbar{#1##1}}}\Ma a\Mb b
    \testeq\xbar{ab}
    \def\foo{###AA#AA}\def\fooB{##AA##AA} \def\fooC{####AAAA}
    \ifx\foo\fooB\else\bad\fi \ifx\foo\fooC\bad\fi}
:::

Note. There are some subtle differences between TeX and *Tralics*.
Assume that X has category code 6, T has category 1 and that you define
`\def\foo xX1yT#1}`. If you ask TeX to print the value, you will see
\\foo=macro: xX1y-\>X1 while *Tralics* says \\foo=macro: x\#1y-\>\#1.
The reason is the following: TeX stores the macro as a single list of
tokens, replacing the start of the body (here T) by a special marker,
and omitting the final brace. This explains why T is not printed. The
body of the macro holds a reference to the first argument so
`\def\xfoo xX1y{X1}` produces the same result, but `\def\yfoo x#1y{#1}`
gives a different result. In case of `\def\foo X1#2{#1}`, the character
used in the body is the last found in the argument list (here a sharp
sign). On the other hand, *Tralics* stores somewhere the list of
characters that are before the first argument (here x), and the
delimitors for the arguments (here y for the first argument). In
particular `\foo`, `\xfoo` and `\yfoo` use the same representation.

As a consequence, comparing macros via `\ifx` may produce different
results; the same holds for `\meaning`. Consider now `\def\foo X1XTX1}`;
TeX prints \\foo=macro: X1T-\>X1T while *Tralics* prints \\foo=macro:
\#1T-\>\#1. Here `\foo` is a macro with one argument delimited by T (of
category code 1), and this character is reinserted after the expansion.
*Tralics* does not show which character it reinserts; in fact it insert
an open brace. One could use `\futurelet` in order to see the
difference.

Finally consider `\newcommand\foo[2][truc]{X1X2}`. You will see
\\xfoo=macro: -\>@<protected@testopt> \\xfoo \\xfoo {truc} in the case
of TeX (this means that TeX created an auxiliary command, whose value is
\\xfoo=long macro:\[\#1\]\#2-\>\#1\#2) or \\xfoo=opt \\long macro:
truc\#2-\>\#1\#2 (this means that *Tralics* did not create other other
commands).

### Catcode 7

The only character with catcode 7 is the hat. This character is used in
math mode for superscripts. It is also used in the double hat construct:
if a character of catcode 7 appears twice in a row, like in `^^13` and
`^^ab`, and is followed by two digits in base 16, it is as if the
character with this code had been given (here, code 19, and 171); note
that only lowercase letters are allowed here. In the case where a
character of catcode 7 appears twice in a row, and is followed by a 7bit
character of code *c* (like `^^Z` or `^^A` or `^^{`), it is as if TeX
had seen a character of code *c-64* or *c+64* (the one which is between
0 and 128). In the example, the numbers are 26, 1 and 59. The catcode of
this character is examined again, for instance `^^5e` is the hat
character, of catcode 7.

Example.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    {1^^{^^ab2^^5e^ab3^^5e^5e^ab4\def\Abc{ok}\def\bAc{OK}\^^41bc\b^^41c}
    {\catcode `\é=7 ééab $xé2$ %next line should produce M
    éé
    $1^è=^^^AééT$}  %line contains hat, hat, control-A
    \def\msg{A message.^^J}
:::

This is the XML translation

::: {.container .xml_out}
    <p>1;«&nbsp;2«&nbsp;3«&nbsp;4okOK
    «&nbsp;<formula type='inline'><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
    <msup><mi>x</mi> <mn>2</mn> </msup></math></formula>
     M<formula type='inline'><math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
    <mrow><msup><mn>1</mn> <mo>è</mo> </msup><mo>=</mo><mi>A</mi>
    <mo>&#20;</mo></mrow></math></formula> </p>
:::

Note: The line that contains the two é characters translates as capital
M, because the last character on the line is the newline character,
control-M (even though on Unix, you would expect control-J). The `\msg`
command contains as last token a newline character (control-J of catcode
12), and not an end-of-line character of catcode 5. The character
control-T, represented by &\#20; seems to be illegal in XML. Without it,
the preview is ![some chars](/img/img_13.png).

If you say `^^^^ABCD`, the result is a character whose value is defined
by the value ABCD (each letter must be a digit, or a lower case letter
between A and F). Such a construct is equivalent to `\char &ABCD`, but
it is one token, and spaces are not ignored after it. (You can also use
five hats, see [the documentation on characters](doc-chars.html)).
Example

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\foo#1#2#3{#1=#2=#3=}
    \foo^^^^0153^^^^0152^^^^0178
     ^^^^017b^^8?

### Catcode 8

The only character with catcode 8 is the underscore character. It is
used for subscripts in math mode. See the `` `\sp ``
\<doc-s.html\#cmd-sp\>\`\_\_ command for an example of use.

Outside math mode, you will get an error. For instance, if you say

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    {\catcode`x7 \catcode`y=8 a^b_c xy\sp\sb}
:::

then *Tralics* will complain (but not in the same fashion as TeX).

::: {.container .tty_out}
    Error signaled at line 377:
    Missing dollar not inserted, token ignored: {Character ^ of catcode 7}.
    Error signaled at line 377:

    Error signaled at line 377:

    Error signaled at line 377:
    Missing dollar not inserted, token ignored: \sp.
    Error signaled at line 377:
    Missing dollar not inserted, token ignored: \sb.
:::

### Catcode 9

Characters of code 9 are ignored. Initially, no character has this
category code.

### Catcode 10

A character of catcode 10 acts like a space. If TeX sees a character of
catcode 10, the action depends on the current state. If the state is *N*
or *S*, the character is ignored. Otherwise, TeX is in state *M* and
changes to state *S*, and the result is a space token (character 32,
category 10). Space, tabulation are of catcode 10.

Spaces are in general ignored at start of line, because TeX is in state
*M*. In verbatim mode, the catcode of the space is changed, and thus
spaces remain.

### Catcode 11

Characters of catcode letter can be used to make multiletter control
sequences (without using `\csname`). Only ASCII letter (between a and z,
or between A and Z) are by default of catcode 11.

### Catcode 12

Characters of catcode 12 cannot be used to make multiletter control
sequences. All characters not liste elsewhere are of catcode 12
(especially, all 8-bit characters).

### Catcode 13

Characters of category 13 are active. They can be used only if a
definition is associated. In *Tralics* only the tilde character is of
13, but the three characters `_#&` have a definition (the translation is
the character). Note that, in PlainTeX, the tilde character expands to
`\penalty \@M \ ` (there is a space at the end of the command) and in
LaTeX to `\nobreakspace{}`, which is the same with a `\leavevmode` in
front, in *Tralics*, the expansion is simply `\nobreakspace`.

### Catcode 14

Characters of catcode 14 act like an start-of-comment character. The
only character with catcode 14 is the percent character.

### Catcode 15

Characters of catcode 15 are invalid. There is no invalid character in
*Tralics*.

### Catcode 16

There is no character of catcode 16 in TeX . In *Tralics*, this code is
reserved for verbatim-like characters, defined by `\DefineShortVerb`.
These characters act is if they were preceded by `\verb`. Note that the
star character is not exceptional. You can use `\fvset`, if you want to
change the translation of a space.

Example:

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \DefineShortVerb{\|}
    Test of |\DefineShortVerb| and |\UndefineShortVerb|.
    \DefineShortVerb{\+}
    test 1 |toto| +x+ |+x-| +|t|+
    \UndefineShortVerb{\+}
    test 2 |toto| +x+ |+x-| +|t|+
    espace: |+ +|\fvset{showspaces=true}|+ +|\fvset{showspaces=false}|+ +|.
    \DefineShortVerb{\*}
    Verbatimfoo: *+ foo +*\verb+*foo*+\verb*+foo*+
    Verbatimfoo: \verb|+ foo +*foo*foo*|.
:::

The XML output is the following

::: {.container .xml_out}
    <p>Test of <hi rend='tt'>\DefineShortVerb</hi> and <hi rend='tt'>\UndefineShortVerb</hi>.

    test 1 <hi rend='tt'>toto</hi> <hi rend='tt'>x</hi> <hi rend='tt'>+x-&#x200B;</hi>

    test 2 <hi rend='tt'>toto</hi> +x+ <hi rend='tt'>+x-&#x200B;</hi> +<hi rend='tt'>t</hi>+
    espace: <hi rend='tt'>+&nbsp;+</hi><hi rend='tt'>+&blank;+</hi><hi rend='tt'>+&nbsp;+</hi>.

    Verbatimfoo: <hi rend='tt'>+&nbsp;foo&nbsp;+</hi><hi rend='tt'>*foo*</hi><hi rend='tt'>foo*</hi>
    Verbatimfoo: <hi rend='tt'>+&nbsp;foo&nbsp;+*foo*foo*</hi>.
    </p>
:::

We can continue the example as follows. We show how to use `\SaveVerb`
and `\UseVerb`.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \SaveVerb{FE}|}|\def\FE{\UseVerb{FE}}
    \DefineShortVerb{\+}

Mono-letter commands
--------------------

### \~

*(tralics version 1 description: The \`\`\~\`\` character is a normal
character, but translates into a non-breaking space. Of course, the
result is a tilde in verbatim mode, and a mathematical space in math
mode.)* Example:

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    Test tilde:~\verb=~=$a~b$.
    \href{\url{a~b\~c}}{some url}
:::

The XML translation is

::: {.container .xml_out}
    Test tilde:&nbsp;<hi rend='tt'>~</hi><formula type='inline'>
    <math xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML'>
    <mrow><mi>a</mi><mspace width='1em'/><mi>b</mi></mrow></math></formula>.
    <xref url='some url'>a~b~c</xref>
:::

Note how `~` and `\~` are handled by the `\url` command.

In the current version of *Tralics*, the tilde character is active and
defined as `\def~{\nobreakspace}`. The only purpose of the change is to
make the following example work (it is file xii by David Carlisle).

### \\\$

The `\$` command is valid in math mode and text mode. It generates a
dollar sign (`<mi>$</mi>` in math mode). See also the description of the
`` `\qquad `` \<doc-q.html\#cmd-qquad\>\`\_\_ command. Remember that the
dollar sign by itself (using default category codes) starts or finishes
a math formula.

### \\%

The `\%` command is valid in math mode and text mode. It generates a
percent sign ( `<mo>%</mo>` in math mode). See also the description of
the `` `\qquad `` \<doc-q.html\#cmd-qquad\>\`\_\_ command. Remember that
the percent sign by itself (using default category codes) starts a
comment.

### \\&

The `\&` command is valid in math mode and text mode. It generates a
ampersand sign `&amp;` (or `<mo>&amp;</mo>` in math mode). See
description of the `` `\qquad `` \<doc-q.html\#cmd-qquad\>[\_\_ command.
Remember that the ]{.title-ref}[&]{.title-ref}[ character is valid only
inside arrays as a cell delimiter (see description of \`arrays
\<doc-array.html\>]{.title-ref}\_\_).

### \\!

The `\!` command is valid in math mode and text mode. It generates a
negative space of -3/18em in math mode `<mspace width='-0.166667em'/>`
and nothing in text mode. See description of the `` `\qquad ``
\<doc-q.html\#cmd-qquad\>\`\_\_ command.

### \\, (backslash comma)

The `\,` command is valid in math mode and text mode. It generates a
space of 3/18em in math mode, `<mspace width='0.166667em'/>`, and a
`&nbsp;` otherwise (this is `&#xA0;`, as defined in isonum.ent).

See description of the `` `\qquad `` \<doc-q.html\#cmd-qquad\>[\_\_
command and ]{.title-ref}`\AA` \<doc-a.html\#cmd-Caa\>\`\_\_ command.

### \\\>

The `\>` command is valid in math mode. It generates a space of 4/18em.
See description of the `` `\qquad `` \<doc-q.html\#cmd-qquad\>\`\_\_
command.

### \\;

The `\;` command is valid in math mode. It generates a space of 5/18em.
See description of the `` `\qquad `` \<doc-q.html\#cmd-qquad\>\`\_\_
command.

### \\{

The `\{` command is valid in math mode and text mode. It generates an
open brace, for instance `<mo>{</mo>` in math mode. See description of
the `` `\qquad `` \<doc-q.html\#cmd-qquad\>[\_\_ command, and
]{.title-ref}`\AA` \<doc-a.html\#cmd-Caa\>[\_\_ command. It can be used
as a math delimiter, see description of the ]{.title-ref}`\vert`
\<doc-v.html\#cmd-vert\>\`\_\_ command.

Note that a single brace (without backslash), assuming default catcodes,
opens a group.

### \\}

The `\}` command is valid in math mode and text mode. It generates an
close brace, for instance `<mo>}</mo>` in math mode. See description of
the `` `\qquad `` \<doc-q.html\#cmd-qquad\>[\_\_ command, and
]{.title-ref}`\AA` \<doc-a.html\#cmd-Caa\>[\_\_ command. It can be used
as a math delimiter, see description of the ]{.title-ref}`\vert`
\<doc-v.html\#cmd-vert\>\`\_\_ command.

Note that a single brace (withut backslash) (assuming default catcodes)
closes a group.

### \\+ (backslash plus)

This command is undefined in *Tralics*; it is part of the unimplemented
`\settabs` mechanism

### \\\_ (backslash underscore)

The `\_` command is valid in math mode and text mode. It generates an
underscore, in math mode it is `<mo>_</mo>` See description of the
`` `\qquad `` \<doc-q.html\#cmd-qquad\>[\_\_ command and
]{.title-ref}`\AA` \<doc-a.html\#cmd-Caa\>\`\_\_ command.

With defaults catcodes, a simple underscore character is valid only in
math mode, and starts a subscript.

### \\- (backslash minus)

The LaTeX kernel contains `\def\-{\discretionary{-}{}{}}`. Since
hyphenation is not implemented in *Tralics*, `\-` produces no result.

The command is also redefined by the tabbing environment, which is not
yet implemented.

Note that hyphens are ligatures:

### \| (vertical bar)

The `|` command it is equivalent to `\vert` as a math delimiter. See
description of the `` `\vert `` \<doc-v.html\#cmd-vert\>\`\_\_ command.

### \\\| (backslash vertical bar)

The `\|` command is valid only in math mode. It is equivalent to
`\Vert`. It produces the character U+2225, ∥. See description of the
`` `\vert `` \<doc-v.html\#cmd-vert\>\`\_\_ command.

### \\\#

The character \# has category 6, is described [here](catcode6) , and
cannot be use to produce a sharp sign, you must used `\#` instead. It is
valid in text and in math mode; you can also use `` `\sharp ``
\<doc-s.html\#cmd-sharp\>[\_\_, that produces the musical sign character
U+266F, ♯. See also description of the ]{.title-ref}`\AA`
\<doc-a.html\#cmd-Caa\>\`\_\_ command.

### \\\\ (backslash backslash)

The `\\` command has three meanings, depending on whether it is in text,
in a text table, or in math table. It can be followed by a star (which
is ignored) and an optional argument in brackets, which is a dimension.
Inside a table, the `\\` indicates the end of the current row, and the
optional argument specifies additional space between rows. This argument
is currently ignored in math mode. Note that `\\` finished the current
cell, the current row, and starts a new row and a new cell. If this is
the last cell in the table, and if it is empty, then the row is removed.
Said otherwise, a `\\` is ignored at the end of a table; it is however
needed before a final `\hline` if you want an horizontal rule at the end
of the table.

Outside a table, a `\\` specifies the end of a paragraph, and the start
of a new one, which is not indented. The optional argument indicates
vertical space to be added (see also the `` `\vskip ``
\<doc-v.html\#cmd-vskip\>[\_\_ command). In a title, the command with
its arguments is replaced by ]{.title-ref}[\@headercr]{.title-ref}[, a
command that produces a space by default. We give here an example of
]{.title-ref}[]{.title-ref}\` outside a table.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    text A \\* text B \\[3mm] text C
    \expandafter\def\csname @headercr\endcsname{; }

:::

The rendering of the `tabular` is not good: first, the width of the
table is the width of the page (changed to 15cm in this example), and
the width of each column is defined by the number of characters in it
(in this example, you do not see a difference, but replacing `a` by
`$a$` would be catastrophic).

You should look at the [page on arrays](doc-array.html). It contains an
example similar to this one. You can see that we changed the algorithm:
a `\hline` implies a `bottom-border` on the previous row.

![example of bbbb in a normal table](/img/img_33.png)

### \[, \\\[

The `[` command can be used as a math delimiter. See description of the
`` `\vert `` \<doc-v.html\#cmd-vert\>\`\_\_ command.

The expansion of `\[` is `$$`. It means: \`begin display math\' but
*Tralics* does no check.

### \], \\\]

The `]` command can be used as a math delimiter. See description of the
`` `\vert `` \<doc-v.html\#cmd-vert\>\`\_\_ command.

The expansion of `\]` is `$$`. It means: \`end display math\' but
*Tralics* does no check. Hence `$a\]b$` and `\]x\[` are valid
expressions.

### (, \\(

The `(` command can be used as a math delimiter. See description of the
`` `\vert `` \<doc-v.html\#cmd-vert\>\`\_\_ command.

The expansion of `\(` is `$`. It means: \`start inline math\' but
*Tralics* does no check. This command is also used as an opening
delimiter by the [ifthen package](doc-i.html#ifthenelse).

### ), \\)

The `)` command can be used as a math delimiter. See description of the
`` `\vert `` \<doc-v.html\#cmd-vert\>\`\_\_ command.

The expansion of `\)` is `$`. It means: \`end inline math\' but
*Tralics* does no check. In particular `$$ a\(\)` is valid; note also
that `\(\)` is an empty math formula. This command is also used as a
closing delimiter by the [ifthen package](doc-i.html#ifthenelse).

### \< (less than sign)

The `<` command can be used as a math delimiter. See description of the
`` `\vert `` \<doc-v.html\#cmd-vert\>[\_\_ command. Otherwise, it
translates like a normal character, but is always printed as
]{.title-ref}[&lt;]{.title-ref}[ in the XML output. There is one
exception: the ]{.title-ref}`rawxml` \<doc-r.html\#env-rawxml\>[\_\_
environment prints the convent verbatim, and the
]{.title-ref}`\xmllatex` \<doc-x.html\#cmd-xmllatex\>\`\_\_ command
print

### \> (greater than sign)

The `>` command can be used as a math delimiter. See description of the
`` `\vert `` \<doc-v.html\#cmd-vert\>\`\_\_ command.

### \' (single quote, apostrophe, straight quote)

This character behaves normally in text mode; it has a special meaning
when *Tralics* reads a number (see [scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint));
it has a special meaning in math mode. Plain TeX defines an active
apostrophe character as follows

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    {\catcode`\'=\active \gdef'{^\bgroup\prim@s}}
    \def\prim@s{\prime\futurelet\next\pr@m@s}
    \def\pr@m@s{\ifx'\next\let\nxt\pr@@@s \else\ifx^\next\let\nxt\pr@@@t
      \else\let\nxt\egroup\fi\fi \nxt}
    \def\pr@@@s#1{\prim@s} \def\pr@@@t#1#2{#2\egroup}
:::

The definition of LaTeX is similar, with `\expandafter` instead of
`\nxt`. In *Tralics*, these lines of TeX code are replaced by some lines
of C++. The effect can be seen on the following example.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    {\tracingall $x' x'' x''' x'''' u_2' v'^3_4$}
:::

The transcript file will hold

::: {.container .log_out}
    {math shift}
    +stack: level + 3
    ...
    Math: $x^{\prime } x^{\prime \prime } x^{\prime \prime \prime } 
    x^{\prime \prime \prime \prime } u_2^{\prime } v^{\prime 3}_4$
:::

We have removed a bunch of lines of the form \`+stack: level\', because
each opening and closing brace changes the current level (by the way, it
is the dollar sign that increases the level first). The XML translation
is the following.

::: {.container .xml_out}

### \\\' (backslash left quote)

The single quote character behaves normally, but has a special meaning
when *Tralics* reads a number (see [scanint](doc-s.html#fct-scanint)).
The `\'` command puts an acute accent over some letters. Do not confuse
with `\acute`, which is a math-only command. Example

### \\ (backslash space)

The `\` command adds a space character to the XML tree. The command name
is formed of a backslash followed by a space, a tabulation, a line-feed,
or a carriage return. Since these characters are of catcode 10 (space),
spaces after them is ignored. At the start of chapter 25 of the
[TeXbook](index.html#texbook), Knuth explains that the result of this
command is as if a space had been given in a context where the space
factor is 1000 (*Tralics* ignores `\spacefactor` and other factors that
modify the space factor). In math mode, the translation is
`<mspace width='4pt'/>`.

Note that `\space` produces a single space.

### \\/ (backslash slash)

The `\/` command is assumed to insert a kern corresponding to the italic
correction, if the last item on the horizontal list is a character or a
ligature, or a kern of width zero in math mode. However, *Tralics*
ignores such subtleties, so that this command does nothing.

### \\\*

This command is valid in math mode only, the translation is a
`<mo>&InvisibleTimes;</mo>`.

### \\@ (backslash atsign)

The LaTeX kernel contains `\def\@{\spacefactor\@m}`. However, *Tralics*
ignores currently space factors, so that this command does nothing. If
the at-sign character is of category \`letter\', then `\@ne` is a single
command; but if it is of category \`other\' (normal case), it is `\@`
followed by some characters, and this often gives an error in LaTeX,
since the `\spacefactor` command cannot be used everywhere.

The description of `\@makeactive` is found near that of `\makeatletter`;
there are som exceptions to this rule: `\@ne` is described as if it were
`\one`.
