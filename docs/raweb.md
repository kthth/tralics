Warning
:::

The contents of this page describe the use of *Tralics* to generate the
activity report of INRIA. As far as I am aware, it is not used for that
anymore, and the specific functionality involved should be considered to
be deprecated; it is likely to disappear in a future version of the
program. The page will remain here for historical reasons.

Introduction
------------

### 1.1 A short history

This file explains the link between *Tralics* and the Raweb.

A short history of the Raweb may be found on the Inria internal web site
[Inria internal
website](http://www.inria.fr/interne/disc/apropos/chantiers/raweb-xml/histoire.html).
The question concerns Inria\'s Annual Activity Report, also known as
"Rapport d\'activité", or "Annexe technique" to the RA or "annexes
scientifiques" to the RA. This is a document, written by the research
teams, at the end of the year N (October, November), and published in
March of year N+1.

Until the 1993 edition (published in 1994), only a paper version
existed. A LaTeX model was used since 1987, designed by Jacques André
then Martin Jourdan. See the following paper, [Une expérience
d\'utilisation de LaTeX : le Rapport d\'activité de
l\'INRIA](http://cahiers.gutenberg.eu.org/cg-bin/article/CG_1988___0_17_0.pdf)
by Louarn in the first Cahiers Gutenberg.

In 1993, contacts were made with the Grif S.A. society, for the design
of a SGML DTD and a LaTeX-to-SGML converter. As a result, Philippe
Louarn was able to put on the web the [RA (year
1994)](http://www.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA94/RA94.html) in its HTML
version. But this was judged too complicated, and for several years, the
HTML was directly produced from the LaTeX source, using latex2html
(example:
[miaou95](http://raweb.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA95/miaou/miaou.html)).

In 1996, a working group (conducted by Albert Benveniste) gave new
specifications: independent modules, grouped into ten sections, etc. A
technical group was created, whose objective was to find a company that
could sell a software (maybe using XML as intermediate language). None
was found, but the design of modules (in LaTeX syntax) was well-defined
by Laurent Pierron and José Grimm. For the Ra98, a Perl script did some
preprocessing, splitting the LaTeX source into modules (one module per
HTML page) (example:
[miaou98](http://raweb.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA98/miaou/miaou.html)).

In 1999, the Scientific Annexes to Inria\'s Annual Report were renamed
RAWEB, to emphasize the role played by the Web (it is available as a
CD-Rom, but no more printed by Inria).

In 2001, the Perl scripts mentioned above evolved into a LaTeX-to-XML
converter (some ideas were borrowed from latex2html, which is also a
Perl script). The main trouble was conversion from XML to Pdf, and we
used tools from the TeX community (by S. Rahtz and D. Carlisle) and
PdfLaTeX. On the other hand, the images in the HTML files were converted
by LaTeX. Additional software (indexes, etc.) was written/used by
Marie-Pierre Durollet.

This gave a complicated object: a Perl script, that converts a LaTeX
file into XML (using Omega as a subprocess for the math) followed by
another Perl script that extracts the math, calls latex, then dvips,
then pstoimg (a Perl script that calls ppmquant, pncrop, and so forth,
whose job is to produce a png image for the math formula), and finally
an XSLT processor for the effective conversion. (example:
[miaou2001](http://raweb.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2001/miaou/miaou.html)).

### 1.2 Birth of Tralics

The big Perl script was rewritten as a C++ translator, renamed
*Tralics*, and got (for version 1.6) a first IDDN number in Dec. 2002.
This software was still able to produce a LaTeX preview of the Raweb:
The source is read, the syntax is tested, a LaTeX file is written for
each module, latex and bibtex are called, the resulting dvi is converted
to PostScript. But the same *Tralics* can be used in a different way:
the source is read, the syntax is tested, an XML file is created, an
XSLT processor is called to generate the XSL/FO, and PdfLaTeX generates
the Pdf (you can also generate an HTML version). (example:
[miaou2003](http://raweb.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2003/miaou/uid0.html)).

Note that in 2003, there were a few people writing their RA directly in
XML. As a consequence, the new *Tralics*, to be be used in 2004, does
only the bare minimum: it converts the LaTeX into XML. There is a Perl
script that does everything else (calling external programs like latex,
xsltproc, etc). A non-obvious point concerns conversion of math and
images into HTML. Currently, a Perl script extracts the math, uses LaTex
to produce a dvi file, which in converted to PostScript then png format.

Since 2005, the XML version of the Raweb is available on the web; its
DTD is different from what *Tralics* produces; the research report
[inria-0000077](http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00000777) describes both DTDs
and the XSL style sheet that does the conversion.

Since 2008, a raweb file is like another file. The pre-processor (with
all its fatal errors) has been removed, as well as the postprocessor.
All commands, specific to the raweb like `\project` are now defined in a
style file (to be used via a class file), they may use some primitives
that extract data from a configuration file.

2. Overview of the system {#overview}
-------------------------

### 2.1 Requirements of the Raweb {#requi}

We give [here](raweb1.html) an example of a real file. It is an abridged
version of the [Report of the MIAOU
project.](http://www.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2003/miaou/uid0.html)
The input to *Tralics* is: one TeX file (that can input other TeX
files), one, two or three bibliography files, and some image files.
These three bibliography files can be merged into a single one; and the
filecontents environment might be used to insert the bibliography in the
TeX source.

In the example, we have three bibliography files:
[miaou2003.bib](raweb1.html#miaou2003bib),
[miaou_foot2003.bib](raweb1.html#miaoufootbib), and
[miaou_refer2003.bib](raweb1.html#miaoureferbib) and one
[image](xml-route.png) (The image is extracted from a power-point
presentation, converted to PostScript, then Pdf; the image shown here is
the png version of the PostScript file obtained via convert; you can see
[this on the web](xml-route-ra.png), and notice a loss of quality.) The
image explains how *Tralics* is connected to the other processes.

When translating a file, *Tralics* can be in Raweb mode or not.
Differences between Raweb and non-raweb modes are tiny: they concern
essentially the bibliography (there are some tests that check if an item
is in the correct bibliography file). In Raweb mode, the input file
should be foo2004.tex, where foo matches the name of team, and the
document class should be ra2004 (replace 2004 by the current year).
Non-ascii characters, as well as uppercase letters are forbidden.

### 2.2 Trivial examples {#triv-exp}

**Example 1.** An important point is that *Tralics* compiles only TeX
files, i.e. whose names end with .tex. If no extension is given, one is
added. The .xml extension is replaced by .tex.

::: {.container .tty_out}
    grimm@medee$ tralics my_file.xml
    This is tralics 2.13.0, a LaTeX to XML translator, running on medee
    Copyright INRIA/MIAOU/APICS 2002-2008, Jos\'e Grimm
    Licensed under the CeCILL Free Software Licensing Agreement
    Fatal error: Cannot open input file my_file.tex
:::

**Example 2.** Earlier versions of *Tralics* refused to translate files
that are not in the current directory.

::: {.container .tty_out}
    grimm@medee$ tralics /floppy/foo etc
    This is tralics 2.8, a LaTeX to XML translator
    Copyright INRIA/MIAOU/APICS 2002-2006, Jos\'e Grimm
    Licensed under the CeCILL Free Software Licensing Agreement
    Fatal error
    Absolute or relative pathnames not allowed: /floppy/foo 
:::

**Example 2bis.** Since version 2.10.7 *Tralics* accepts to translate
files that are not in the current directory. By default, the XML result
and transcript files are put in the same directory as the input, but
this can be changed.

::: {.container .tty_out}
    maclaurin@grimm$  tralics ../Test/hello -outputdir=/tmp -logfile=x -silent
    This is tralics 2.15.4, a LaTeX to XML translator, running on maclaurin

    Starting translation of file ../Test/hello.tex.
    Output written on /tmp/hello.xml (187 bytes).
    No error found.
    (For more information, see transcript file /tmp/x.log)
:::

**Example 3.** In the examples 3 to 6, we use the -silent switch to
reduce verbosity, and we translate a trivial TeX file. Here we
demontrate the -dir switch. This option has currrently no effect
anymore.

::: {.container .tty_out}
    maclaurin@grimm$ tralics hello -dir none -silent
    This is tralics 2.15.4, a LaTeX to XML translator, running on maclaurin
    Copyright INRIA/MIAOU/APICS/MARELLE 2002-2015, Jos\'e Grimm
    Licensed under the CeCILL Free Software Licensing Agreement
    Starting translation of file hello.tex.
    Output written on hello.xml (187 bytes).
    No error found.
    (For more information, see transcript file hello.log)
:::

**Example 4.** Here we say that we do not want a configuration file.

::: {.container .tty_out}
    grimm@medee$ tralics -noconfig hello -silent
    This is tralics 2.8, a LaTeX to XML translator
    Copyright INRIA/MIAOU/APICS 2002-2006, Jos\'e Grimm
    Licensed under the CeCILL Free Software Licensing Agreement
    Starting xml processing for hello.
    No configuration file.
    Output written on hello.xml (171 bytes).
    No error found.
    (For more information, see transcript file hello.log)
:::

**Example 5.** In version 2.8, you could set the shell variable
`TRALICSDIR` to a directory containing the configuration file. This has
no effect any more, and the translation is the same as in example 3.

::: {.container .tty_out}
    grimm@medee$ TRALICSDIR=.. tralics hello -silent
    This is tralics 2.13.0, a LaTeX to XML translator, running on medee
    ...
    (For more information, see transcript file hello.log)
:::

**Example 6.** Here the configuration file is found via default rules.
Translation is the same as in example 3.

::: {.container .tty_out}
    grimm@medee$ tralics hello -silent
    ...
    (For more information, see transcript file hello.log)
:::

In all these examples, the TeX file contains a single line
`Hello, world!`. The translation is

::: {.container .xml_out}
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='iso-8859-1'?>
    <!DOCTYPE unknown SYSTEM 'unknown.dtd'>
    <!-- translated from latex by tralics 2.8-->
    <unknown>
    <p>Hello, world!
    </p></unknown>
:::

There are some differences between version 2.8 and the current version.
For instance the compilation date has been added in the XML, thus making
it a bit larger (192 bytes instead of 171). The default encoding is now
UTF-8, this makes the file smaller; finally, the length of the version
number impacts the length of the XML result. The sentence "starting xml
processing for hello" has been replaced by "Starting translation of file
hello.tex". If the -silent option is given, information about
configuration file is not printed on the terminal.

**Raweb mode** is entered if the *type* is `ra`. The *type* can be
specified in the configuration file (the .tralics_rc file; we assume
that either no configurationn file, or the standard configuration one
will be used). If you call *Tralics* with option type=foo, then the
*type* will be `foo`. Otherwise, if you call *Tralics* with option
config=bar2005, and if bar2005.tcf exists, the *type* will be `bar`.
Otherwise, if the file has `\documentclass{gee2003}`, and gee2003.tcf or
gee.tcf exists, then the *type* will be `gee`; otherwise some default
type will be used. The tcf file will be loaded, if given or deduced.

Let\'s assume that we have a file containing two lines, the first one is
`\documentclass{ra2003}`, the second one is `Hello,     world!` as
above. Assume that the file has three names xhello.tex, hello2003.tex
and hello2006.tex. All these files will be translated in Raweb mode. No
XML file will be produced unless the four digits that appear in the
document class are also in the file name, this is the case only for
hello2003.

**Example 7.** We translate here file xhello.tex. Since the file name
has no digits in it, you will get an error of the form *Input file name
must be team name followed by 2008*. With version 2.8, the -verbose
switch produces a great number of lines, explaining what happens
(current version is less verbose).

**Example 8.** You can use the option -year=2008; this sets a variable
to be 2008; in Raweb mode, this can produce an error of the form *Option
-year=2008 incompatible with year in source file*, is ignored otherwise.
Even without this switch, the file will not compile, because of a
mismatch between the year of the file, and that of the document class.

**Example 9.** Final test: we translate the file hello2003. *Tralics*
version 2.8 uses a preprocessor that complains in case of unbalanced
environments.

:::

**Example 10.** In version 2.10.7, the preprocessor is not called if the
year is 2007 or greater (this is indicated by the line *Simplified RA*).
Thus, we can copy hello2003 into hello2007, replacing 2003 by 2007 is
the document class. Compilation succeeds.

**Example 11.** In version 2.13, both the preprocessor and
postprocessors are removed. Note the following differences between
examples 10 and 11. The line *Simplified RA* has been removed, as well
as the two lines dealing with the postprocessor. There is a file
ra2007.tcf but no file ra2003.tcf (because ra.tcf can be used instead).
Finally, the class file ra2007.clt was added to the system after example
10 was run.

    (For more information, see transcript file hello2003.log)
:::

In Raweb mode, the magic line `\AtBeginDocument{\rawebstartdocument}` is
executed. The effect of this command is to translate the metadata (name
of the team, etc); it is defined by the class file. Our little file
compiles because there is no `\begin{document}`. Translation is

::: {.container .xml_out}
    <?xml version='1.0' encoding='iso-8859-1'?>
    <!DOCTYPE raweb SYSTEM 'raweb7.dtd'>
    <!-- Translated from latex by tralics 2.10.7, date: 2007/11/03-->
    <raweb language='english' creator='Tralics version 2.10.7' year='2007'>
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    </raweb>
:::

*Tralics* version 2.15.4 however complains with *No module in section
composition* and four other errors; this is because the configuration
file imposes these sections to be non-empty (they are marked "special"
in the configuration file). On the other hand, there is no problem with
hello2007. Note: the year field in `raweb` element is the same as the
document class, and not the compilation date.

### 2.3 Main document {#main-doc}

We make here the following assumption: the document is named
foo2003.tex, the document class is ra2003 (same year), and a
configuration file specifying type RA is seen. In this case, RA mode is
entered. Before 2007, there was a preprocessor, that did some checks,
rearranged the code, etc. In what follows, we explain what happens with
the example of 2003 and what is new in 2007 or 2008.

A first difference in 2007 is that you will not see *fatal error,
missing \\project* anymore (a normal error will be signaled instead when
translating the start of the document). A well-formed configuration file
is required. If you get a message like the following, please contact the
raweb team.

::: {.container .tty_out}
    Read tcf file ra2007.tcf
    The configuration file for the RA is ra2007.tcf or ra.tcf
    It must define a value for the parameter ur_vals
    See transcript file apics2007.log for details
    No xml file generated
    Fatal_error for apics2007
:::

#### 2.3.1 The Configuration File {#conffile}

The configuration file for the raweb is named ra.tcf (generic code) or
ra2008.tcf (this one is specific to the year 2008). Its content is
similar to what is described [here](doc-step.html#fourth-doc). The
generic ra.tcf configuration file has a block of commands, the specific
files have none (all commands specific to the raweb are now in the
ra.plt file, included by the `\documentclass` command). The file starts
with

::: {#confspec8 .container .ltx-source}
    DocType = raweb raweb7.dtd
    DocAttrib = year \specialyear
    DocAttrib = creator \tralics
:::

This has as effect to define the preamble of the XML result file (see
translation of example 10 above). There are lines of the following form:

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    bibtex_fields = "x-editorial-board" 
    bibtex_fields = "+x-international-audience" 
    bibtex_fields = "+x-proceedings" 
    bibtex_fields = "+x-invited-conference"
    bibtex_fields = "+x-scientific-popularization" 
    bibtex_fields = "+x-pays"
    bibtex_fields = "+url-hal" 
    bibtex_extensions = "patent standard"
    bibtex_extensions = "+hdrthesis" 
:::

The left hand side may be bibtex_extensions or bibtex_fields, the right
hand side is a space-separated list of items (you can insert line breaks
as in the case of fullsection_vals below). The list may start with a
plus sign; this means append to the previous value (default is overwrite
it). The meaning of these lines is the following: when *Tralics*
interprets the bibliography, it recognizes (for every entry type) the
fields x-editorial-board, x-international-audience, etc, including
url-hal; it also recognizes the entry types patent, standard and
hdrthesis. An element in the list may be preceded by a minus sign; in
which case, it will be ignored (ignoring entry types may provoke
undefined references). Assume for instance that the bibliography
contains

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    @phdthesis{TEILR09,
    title = {TEI},
    author = {Laurent Romary},
    school = {Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin},
    url =  "http://www.hu-berlin.de/",
    year = 2015, 
    x-editorial-board = "yes",
    x-international-audience = "yes",
    x-proceedings = "no",
    x-invited-conference = "yes",
    x-scientific-popularization = "yes",
    x-pays = {xx,yy}  ,
    x-other = "ignored" ,
    url-hal ="http://hal.inria.fr/",
    }
    @patent{Algo09,
    author = {Gaëtan Bisson and Răzvan Bărbulescu},
    Title = {Algorithmes unicode pour les lettres Ààéçœ et Ñ},
    year = 2015,
    x-pays= {CH,HK}
    }
:::

Assume moreover that the school field has to be omitted. The translation
is now

:::

Finally, the ra2008.tcf file contains also the following lines that
defines five lists.

::: {#confspec .container .ltx-source}
    section_vals = "composition*/presentation*/fondements/domaine/logiciels/"
    section_vals = "+resultats/contrats*/international*/diffusion*/"
    theme_vals = "Com Cog Num Sym Bio"
    ur_vals = "Rocquencourt//Sophia/Sophia Antipolis/Rennes//Lorraine//";
    ur_vals = "+RhoneAlpes/Rh\^one-Alpes/Futurs//"
    affiliation_vals ="Inria//Cnrs//University//ForeignUniversity//"
    affiliation_vals ="+Public//Other//"
    profession_vals = "Scientist//Assistant//Technical//PHD//"
    profession_vals = "+PostDoc//StudentIntern//Other//"
:::

The quantity theme_vals is a list of words, separated by spaces,
converted to lower case. The quantity section_vals is a list of words,
separated by slash characters (with possibly a star at the end; these
are called "special"). For all other variables of the form
something_vals, it is a list of pairs, name and value, separated by
slashes. If the value is empty, the name is used instead. An initial
plus sign means continuation. The final slash can be omitted; an initial
slash is ignored.

Since 2007, the English title associated to a (French) section name has
been moved to the configuration file; it is given by fullsection_vals
(that should be used instead of section_vals; with this syntax, there
are no "special" sections anymore). As the following demonstrates, you
can put a string on more than one line, provided that the last character
on the line is a backslash.

::: {#confspec1 .container .ltx-source}
    fullsection_vals = "/composition/Team/presentation/Overall Objectives/\
       fondements/Scientific Foundations/domaine/Application Domains/\
       logiciels/Software/resultats/New Results/\
       contrats/Contracts and Grants with Industry/\
       international/Other Grants and Activities/diffusion/Dissemination"
    xml_rasection = "section"
:::

The translation of a section, for instance composition, is
`<composition>`. If the configuration file defines xml_rasection, this
will be the name of the element; the value extracted from
fullsection_vals becomes an attribute; example `<section titre='Team'>`.
Note that the start and end of a section is determined by the modules it
contains.

The transcript file contains some lines, showing how *Tralics*
interprets the configuration file. You might see the following lines.

::: {.container .log_out}
    theme_vals=Com Cog Num Sym Bio
    Section: composition -> Team
    Section: presentation -> Overall Objectives
    Section: fondements -> Scientific Foundations
    Section: domaine -> Application Domains
    Section: logiciels -> Software
    Section: resultats -> New Results
    Section: contrats -> Contracts and Grants with Industry
    Section: international -> Other Grants and Activities
    Section: diffusion -> Dissemination

    UR: Sophia -> Sophia Antipolis
    UR: Rennes -> Rennes

    UR: Futurs -> Futurs
:::

#### 2.3.2 Interpreting the Configuration File

*Tralics* has a command `` `\tralics@get@config{X}{Y} ``
\<doc-t.html\#cmd-tralicsfindconfig\>\`\_\_ that returns a value Z,
according to the following rules.

-   It is an error if X is `foo`, and if the configuration file does not
    specifies foo_vals, or if Y is not in the list.
-   The value associated to Y in the list is returned.
-   If X is `theme`, then Y is converted to lower case; this will be Z.
-   If you say `` `\tralics@interpret@rc{foo,bar} ``
    \<doc-t.html\#cmd-tralicsinterpretrc\>\`\_\_, this checks that all
    arguments are in the list ur_vals and marks them as possible
    locations. If a single item is given, it will be the default
    location.
-   If X is `ur`, then Z is Y, if Y is a possible location. An initial
    plus sign is discarded: if Y is correct, it becomes the default
    location. If Y is empty, the default location will be used. An error
    is signaled otherwise.
-   If X is `fullsection`, let k be the current section number, and K
    the position of Y in the section list (this could be section_vals or
    fullsection_vals). If Y is empty, an error is signaled if there is
    no current section, otherwise K is k. An error is signaled if Y is
    not in the list; an error is signaled if K is less than k ; an error
    also is signaled if K=k and Y is `composition` (details are given
    later). After that, K becomes the current section number. The value
    Z is empty if K=k, the value associated to Y otherwise.
-   If X is `section`, then if the section number *k* (defined as above)
    is "special", then Z is empty. Otherwise Z is Y (or `default` if Y
    is empty).

#### 2.3.3 The main document

The main Raweb document has the following structure

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \documentclass{ra2003}         %001
    <Header>
    \begin{document}               %016
    \maketitle                     %019
    <Modules>
    \loadbiblio                    %488
    \end{document}                 %489
:::

Here, and in the examples that follow, blue numbers are the line numbers
of the corresponding lines in the example file. Things like \<Modules\>
are explained below. The `\documentclass` should be `ra2006` for the
year 2006.

**Note.** The two commands `\maketitle` and `\loadbiblio` are now
obsolete.

#### 2.3.4 The header

The header of the file is everything before `\begin{document}`. It
should not produce any text. There is a free part and a required one,
they can be intermixed. The free part contains definitions and
`\usepackage` commands. We recommend to always use `\newcommand` instead
of `\def` (do not follow the example). You should *not* load packages
like `french` or `babel`, because the current language of the Raweb is
English. For instance:

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \usepackage{amsfonts}          %002
    \usepackage{amsmath}
    \def\CC{{\mathbb C}}           %009
    \newcommand{\etc}{etc}
    \def\corresp{manager}
:::

The required part of the header contains lines like the following

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \projet{MIAOU}{Miaou}{Mathématiques et 
         Informatique de l'Automatique et de l'Optimisation pour 
      l'Utilisateur}               %006
    \theme{4a}                     %004
    \isproject{YES} % \isproject{OUI} works also %005
    \UR{\URSophia}                 %007
:::

See [Changes in 2007](#fmodule7) and [Changes in 2008](#fmodule8) for
some changes introduced for the RA2007 or RA2008. There are no fatal
errors any more.

#### 2.3.5 The Team Name and Properties

The `\isproject` command take one argument that should be true if the
team is a Project-Team (according to local terminology). The current
version of the ra.plt package uses the xkeyval mechanism in order to
allow variants (équipes, actions transversales, whatever, see
instructions).

The `\project` command (it can be spelled as `\projet`) takes three
arguments Uname, Sname and Lname. Here Sname is the short name of the
Team, and Lname its long name. The short name could be as complicated as
πr^2^. The long name is a bit more explicit and should be in English.

The first argument Uname should match the file name, miaou2003.tex. The
code that follows uses `` `\ra@jobname ``
\<doc-r.html\#cmd-rajobname\>[\_\_, this holds
]{.title-ref}[miaou]{.title-ref}[. It is like
]{.title-ref}[jobname]{.title-ref}[, except that the directory part, and
the year has been stripped; in particular, all characters have category
code 12 (except for space), so ]{.title-ref}[detokenize]{.title-ref}\`
has to be used. In earlier versions, Uname had to be all uppercase.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \edef\tmpB{\ra@jobname}
    \def\tmpA##1{\lowercase{\xdef\tmpA{\detokenize{##1}}}}
    \expandafter\tmpA\expandafter{\ra@proj@a}
    \ifx\tmpA\tmpB \else\PackageError{Raweb}{Invalid Team name \ra@proj@a}{}\fi
:::

#### 2.3.6 The Theme

The `\theme` command takes as argument a Theme (Research Teams are
grouped into domains, split into themes). Between 1996 and 2003,
research themes were identified by a digit, between 1 and 4, followed by
a letter; giving `4a` as argument has as effect to insert in the HTML a
link to the [theme
4](http://www.inria.fr/recherche/equipes/listes/theme_4.en.html) (this
link is probably broken now). In 2004, the list of domains/themes
changed, and checking become more complex. You can see errors of the
form *Invalid theme 4a, Valid themes are com cog num sym bio*, where the
list comes from the configuration file (converted to lower case). Here
COM stands for "Communicating systems", one of its themes being
"Distributed systems and software architecture"). In 2009, the list
changed again: *apics* (successor of *miaou*) is in domain
"Mathématiques appliquées, calcul et simulation" (in English "Applied
Mathematics, Computation and Simulation"), and theme "Modeling,
Optimization, and Control of Dynamic Systems". This information, as well
as a link to the correct URL, is now inserted into the HTML or Pdf
version of the RA by an xsl stylesheet, according to the value of the
team name. As a consequence, the argument of the `\theme` command is now
ignored.

#### 2.3.7 The Localisation

The `\UR` command takes as argument a list of Research Units. The
default configuration file shown above gives the list of valid names. In
2007 they are `Rocquencourt`, `Sophia`, `Rennes`, `Lorraine`,
`RhoneAlpes` and `Futurs`. Since then `Futurs` has been replaced by
`Bordeaux`, `Lille` and `Saclay`. Before 2007, you had to say
`\UR{\URSophia}` (for a team in a single UR) or
`\UR{\URFuturs\URSophia}` for a team in two URs. This is still accepted,
but the recommended syntax is now `\UR{Sophia}` (for a team in a single
UR) or `\UR{Futurs,Sophia}` where the comma could be replaced by a
space. The list is interpreted by `` `\tralics@interpret@rc ``
\<doc-t.html\#cmd-tralicsinterpretrc\>\`\_\_ that can signal an error of
the form:

::: {.container .tty_out}
    Error signaled at line 22 of file exemple2006.tex:
    Illegal localisation value: Saclay
    Use one or more of: Rocquencourt Sophia Rennes Lorraine RhoneAlpes Futurs.
:::

#### 2.3.8 The Topics

The last part of the header is the Topic declaration. Example

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \declaretopic{abc}{Topic abc}  %013
    \declaretopic{def}{Topic def}
:::

Topics are defined if the ra.plt package is called with option `topic`.
Otherwise the two lines above are ignored as well as the optional
argument of the module environment. Topics have been declared obsolete
in 2007, so they exist only for compatibility reason, and no error is
signaled anymore. Each topic has a name and a title. The name can be an
optional argument of `module` (see the example, lines
[79](raweb1.html#079), [207](raweb1.html#207) [212](raweb1.html#212) and
[322](raweb1.html#322).) Topics are handled via a call to
`\tralics@get@config{section}{XX}`. See for instance the reports of [isa
2003](http://www.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2003/isa2003/isa_tf.html),
[isa
2004](http://www.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2004/isa2004/isa_tf.html)
or [odyssee
2005](http://www.inria.fr/rapportsactivite/RA2005/odyssee/odyssee_tf.html).

#### 2.3.9 Preprocessor Limitations

We list here some errors signaled by the preprocessor; this concerns
only the RA2006 and before.

Lines containing `\theme` etc, should not contain anything else after
the arguments. Replacing the % line 5 by a \_ will give this message

::: {.container .tty_out}
    Error signaled at line 5:
    Characters ignored at end of line
    current line is  _ \isproject{OUI} works also
    error is at position 1 at character _ (ascii 95).
    Fatal_error for miaou2003
:::

You cannot say `\def\foo{YES}\isproject\foo`, because the program looks
for explicit braces. Example:

::: {.container .tty_out}
    Error signaled at line 5:
    Characters ignored before open brace
    error signaled while scanning isproject
    current line is \foo % \isproject{OUI} works also
    error is at position 0 at character \ (ascii 92).
    Fatal_error for miaou2003
:::

Before 2006, *Tralics* created file, named \_hyperref.cfg, containing
all the keywords in alphabetic order. You could see errors of the form

::: {.container .tty_out}
    Error at line 107
    Strange keywords 

    meromorphic approximation, frequency-domain identification,
    extremal problems {$(\max,+)$}
:::

The `participants` environment should contain only `\pers{}{}[]`
commands, separated by commas.

::: {.container .tty_out}
    Error signaled at line 253:

    Fatal_error for miaou2003
:::

The `\pers` command can be used in a `participants` or `catperso`
environment. In one case, you must use commas as separators, in the
other case, you cannot. In the current version, the comma after `\pers`
is optional, so that you won\'t see

::: {.container .tty_out}
    Error signaled at line 253:

:::

### 2.4 Modules

A module is an environment, with some arguments: an optional topic
reference (see above), and three required arguments (section, name,
title). It is followed by an optional interface (formed of contributors,
keywords, glossary, and moreinfo) and text. Since a module is
essentially a `\subsection`, the text should contain only
`\subsubsection` and `\paragraph` commands. Modules cannot be nested.
The first module is special, we shall explain it later. The second
module looks like this

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \begin{module}{presentation}{presentation}{} %047
    \begin{moreinfo}                             %048
    The project was terminated June the 30th, 2003. 
    A proposal for a new project named APICS has been submitted to the steering
    committee of Inria Sophia Antipolis.
    \end{moreinfo}
    ...
    \end{module}                                 %076
:::

It should be a small description of the main research objectives of the
Team. You can use the `moreinfo` environment for emphasizes (in this
example, to indicate that this is the last RA for the miaou Team).
Historical note: Miaou has been effectively dissolved on 2003-31-12, was
replaced by Apics on 2004-01-01, which became a Project on 2005-01-01.

The standard configuration file [(see above)](#confspec) defines nine
sections. The Raweb DTD associates to each section an English name,
shown in parenthesis here. Since 2007, the names have been moved to the
configuration file [(see above)](#confspec1)

1.  composition (Team) example [line 22](raweb1.html#022) This section
    gives the list of the members of the Team; see below.
2.  presentation (Overall Objectives), example [line
    47](raweb1.html#047) General presentation of the team, and overall
    objectives.
3.  fondements (Scientific Foundations), example [line
    79](raweb1.html#079). This should explain the (scientific) tools and
    methodology used by the Team.
4.  domaine (Application Domains), [example line 183](raweb1.html#183),
    [line 187](raweb1.html#187), [line 201](raweb1.html#201), [line
    207](raweb1.html#207), [line 212](raweb1.html#212), [line
    217](raweb1.html#217). This is a very important section. You should
    use the following official keywords: telecommunications, multimedia,
    biology, health, process engineering, transportation systems,
    environment.
5.  logiciels (Software), [example line 231](raweb1.html#231), [line
    241](raweb1.html#241), [line 249](raweb1.html#249), [line
    262](raweb1.html#262), [line 273](raweb1.html#273) Each piece of
    software should be described here. You should use `[correspondant]`
    as moreinfo field for one of the team members.
6.  resultats (New Results), example [line 286](raweb1.html#286), [line
    314](raweb1.html#314), [line 318](raweb1.html#318), [line
    359](raweb1.html#359). This section explains the new results found
    by the Team.
7.  contrats (Contracts and Grants with Industry), example [line
    322](raweb1.html#322), [line 338](raweb1.html#338), [line
    346](raweb1.html#346). You should explain here the work funded by
    Industry.
8.  international (Other Grants and Activities), example [line
    366](raweb1.html#366), [line 380](raweb1.html#380), [line
    401](raweb1.html#401), [line 407](raweb1.html#407). In this section,
    you describe contacts with other Teams (in France, Europe, and rest
    of the Word).
9.  diffusion (Dissemination), example [line 433](raweb1.html#433),
    [line 468](raweb1.html#468), [line 474](raweb1.html#474). Here you
    describe Teaching activities, etc.

The first argument of a module, the section, is handled by calling
`\tralics@get@config{fullsection}{#1}` whose behavior is described
[above](#fullsection). If this defines a new section, the previous
section (if any) is popped via `` `\tralics@pop@section ``
\<doc-t.html\#cmd-tralicspopsection\>[\_\_ and a new section is created
via ]{.title-ref}`\tralics@push@section{#1}`
\<doc-t.html\#cmd-tralicspushsection\>\`\_\_.

The section may be empty, case where no new section is created. If there
is no current section, you will see an error of the form *No default
section*. Normally, "composition" is the first module (see below) and
the first section. So, if the first module has an empty section and is
followed by the composition, you will see a second error *Composition
must be before first module* and a third *Only one module accepted in
composition*. If a module with empty section follows the composition,
you will only see the last of these three message.

If the section is not in the list of valid sections defined by the
configuration file, you will get an error of the form *Invalid section
Domaine* followed by *Valid sections are composition presentation
fondements domaine logiciels resultats contrats international diffusion*
(it could be followed by the errors listed above).

**Note** You can notice that the module starting at [line
359](raweb1.html#359) is in the section "resultats", but it comes after
the modules of the section "contrats". This is allowed by the
preprocessor : modules are re-ordered. This feature is removed in 2007.
You will see the error *Bad section fondements after diffusion* followed
by *Order of sections is composition presentation fondements domaine
logiciels resultats contrats partenariat diffusion* (it could be
followed by a second error).

The second item in a module, name, is a symbolic name, that uniquely
defines the module; it must be unique, or else an error of the form
*Class Raweb Error: Duplicate module: dif-anim* is signaled. Since a
label (for instance `mod:presentation`, is created and anchored to the
module, there will be another error *Label \'mod:dif-anim\' multiply
defined (first use line 667 file exemple2006.tex)*. Trying to use
special commands (for instance math formulas) can produce errors of the
form *unexpected element formula*.

Finally a module has a title. In the example, three modules have an
empty title: [line 22](raweb1.html#022), [line 47](raweb1.html#047), and
[line 183](raweb1.html#183). This is somehow weird, so, unless ra.plt is
loaded with option `emptymodule`, an empty title is replaced by
`(Sans Titre)`. Before 2008, a complicated algorithm was used by the
post-processor to deal with the case of empty modules titles. In the
current version, an error is signaled and a default title is used.

### 2.5 Module Interface {#modules-i}

A typical module should contain an interface and a body. The interface
is formed of contributors, keywords, glossary, and moreinfo. The
original idea was that body is defined by a `body` environment. This has
been simplified: it can be any text, including subsections with their
own interface. In a section like "Overall objectives", you do not cite
contributors (because you talk about the whole Team), and in a section
like "Dissemination", you do not cite them either (in fact, names appear
in the body of the module, for instance [line 436](raweb1.html#436) and
[line 470](raweb1.html#470)). Example

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \begin{module}{}{calcul formel}{Software aspects of computer algebra}
      \begin{participants}
        \pers{Jean}[de]{La Fontaine}[1621-1695]
        \pers{Cecil Blount}{De Mille}
      \end{participants}
      \begin{motscle}
        mot1, mot2, mot3
      \end{motscle}
      \begin{glossaire}
        \glo{trick}{the thing which makes go the thingummy}
        \glo{BabelFish}{the translator of the previous sentence}
      \end{glossaire}
      \begin{moreinfo}
        This work was sponsored by all the sponsors
      \end{moreinfo}
      This is the body of the module.
    \end{module}
:::

The moreinfo is technically a `moreinfo` environment. It is formed of a
short paragraph (of the form: "this work done in collaboration with X").

The keywords are indicated by the `motscle` environment; examples are
given at [line 104](raweb1.html#104), [line 136](raweb1.html#136), [line
193](raweb1.html#193), [line 202](raweb1.html#202), and [line
225](raweb1.html#225). The environment contains a comma separated list
of keywords. The last example shows how to put commas into a keyword.
Keywords have become obsolete. Later on, the powers that be have
reintroduced a global list of keywords, with a different syntax.

A glossary is a `glossaire` environment in which you can put `\glo`
commands; they take two arguments: a word and its description. There is
a dummy example [line 475](raweb1.html#104). In the current version,
there is no possibility to make a reference to the items of the
glossary.

A contributors list is given by a `participants` environment. Since
2008, this produces a `<participants>` element. For compatibility
reasons with the initial (French) version, you can use `participant`,
`participante` or `participantes`. If the ra package is called with
option `participant`, then the name of the element is the name of the
environment. Inside the environment, empty lines are ignored and `\pers`
is defined to be `\persA`. Examples are [line 094](raweb1.html#094),
[line 126](raweb1.html#126), [line 189](raweb1.html#189), [line
219](raweb1.html#219), [line 233](raweb1.html#233), [line
243](raweb1.html#243), [line 250](raweb1.html#250), [line
265](raweb1.html#265), and [line 274](raweb1.html#274).

### 2.6 First Module {#f-module}

#### 2.6.1 Original syntax {#fmodule3}

The first section contains a single module, for instance, the one
starting at [line 22](raweb1.html#022). Its name is useless. It should
contain only `catperso` environments (but this is not checked). Examples
are [line 24](raweb1.html#024), [line 28](raweb1.html#028), [line
32](raweb1.html#032), [line 36](raweb1.html#036), and [line
40](raweb1.html#040). Each such environment has a title, and contains a
list of names, like the `participants` environment, without commas.

The syntax of the `\pers` command is the following: first name,
particle, last name and moreinfo. An example is the following:
\\pers{Jean}\[de\]{La Fontaine}\[1621-1695\]. Arguments in braces an
mandatory, arguments in brackets are optional. We recommend the syntax
`\pers{Jean}{de la   Fontaine}`, since *Tralics* does nothing with the
particle apart prefixing it to the last name. In the first module, the
moreinfo may indicate that some contributor has a grant from Inria, or
whatever, and for non permanent people, their arrival, and departure
date (as in [line 43](raweb1.html#043)); this could also indicate a
collaboration of another organism, for instance like in [line
97](raweb1.html#097);

#### 2.6.2 The 2006 semantics {#fmodule6}

In 2006, the syntax of `\pers` changed. The `\persA` command is the one
described above, the syntax of `\persB` is first name, particle, last
name (same meaning as above), CR, profession, affiliation, moreinfo,
HDR. The last two arguments are optional; a non-empty value of HDR means
that the person has a "Thèse d\'état" or a "Habilitation à diriger les
Recherches". The CR argument was introduced in 2007, and is described in
section 2.6.3.

The profession and affiliation arguments must be used after the last
name. The value is restricted to what is defined by the [configuration
file](#confspec). Example

#### 2.6.3 The 2007 changes {#fmodule7}

Topics have become obsolescent. This means that *Tralics* recognises the
syntax, but ignores all values. A new feature has been added: the start
of the document optionally contains a line of the form
`\TeamHasHdr{yes}`. A true value means: at least one staff member has a
Hdr (see discussion about the `\pers` command). This feature has been
removed in 2008.

The following three lines are equivalent; they say that the team is
located in both Rocquencourt and Sophia. Recall that "UR" stands for
Unité de Recherche (Research Unit), and this is nowadays called Research
Center.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \UR{\URRocquencourt\URSophia }
    \UR{Rocquencourt,Sophia }
    \ResearchCentreList{Rocquencourt,Sophia}
:::

Since 2007 you must indicate, for every staff member, its localisation
(Rocquencourt or Sophia, in the example above). This is done by adding
an optional argument to the `\pers` command. Of course, the optional
argument is required only if the RC list has more than one element.
Example

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \begin{catperso}{Team Leader}
    \pers{Laurent}{Baratchart}[Sophia]{Chercheur}{INRIA}[DR Inria][Habilite]
    \end{catperso}
:::

In the example that follows, the equals sign says that Sophia becomes
the default value (so that there is no need to repeat it).

#### 2.6.4 The 2008 changes {#fmodule8}

Before 2008, the first section consisted in a module consisting of a
sequence of `catperso` environments. Such an environment takes one
argument, a category of people. As the examples show, the values are
very diverse (compare `Head of project team` with `Team leader`), so
there was an attempt to limit the values to those defined in the
configuration file, before the replacement by a unique environment
`composition`, outside any module.

Remember that the `\pers` command comes in two versions `\persA`
(simple) and `\persB` (complicated). These are commands are defined in
the ra.plt package file, included from the class file (for instance
ra2009.clt) with some options. You should use the `\pers` command only
in two cases: inside a `participant` environment (and then it is
`\persA`), or in the first module. If this one is defined by
`composition` (2008 and later), then `\pers` is made undefined outside
`participant` and `composition`. It is `\persA` if the package is loaded
with option `old` (2005 and before) and `\persB` otherwise (2006 and
later). Example for 2008:

:::

#### 2.6.5 The 2013 changes

The affiliation part of the `\pers` command has been removed (and the
command is defined as `\persC`). Example (with a CR part).

### 2.7 References

Our example contains [line 92](raweb1.html#092) a `\label` that is
referenced at [line 329](raweb1.html#329). This label is associated to a
section (starting at line [line 90](raweb1.html#090)). You can also
associate a label with an equation ([line 141](raweb1.html#141)) or a
figure ([line 304](raweb1.html#304)) (note that the label has nothing to
do with the `\caption` that follows; references to the figure will be
correct after translation, but incorrect if LaTeX is called directly).

You can reference a module via the `\moduleref[y]{p}{s}{name}`. Since
2006, the optional argument has been removed, and the command is
equivalent to `\ref{mod:name}` (if the last argument is non-empty, to
`\ref{section:s}` otherwise). The original idea was to refer to the
module "name" in section "s" of the activity report of team "p" for year
"y" (this worked in principle for the HTML version of the RA as the name
of the HTML page depended only on this quantities; it never worked in
the PDF version). So the year has to be the current year, the team has
to be the current team and the section could be deduced from the module
name, whence the current implementation. There is an example [line
330](raweb1.html#330) and some more at [line 410](raweb1.html#410) (if
the module name is empty, the link points to the section).

You can use the `\href` command for external references, like in [line
258](raweb1.html#258), [line 280](raweb1.html#280), [line
384](raweb1.html#384), [line 394](raweb1.html#394), [line
398](raweb1.html#398), [line 481](raweb1.html#481).

In the bibliography, you can add a `url` field, like [this
one](raweb1.html#bib-Avan-Bar-Pom03rr). We provide the `\rrrt` command:
its argument is the number of a Inria Research report. Example
[here](raweb1.html#bib-Bara-Chy-Pom03).

It is also possible to give the `doi`: in [this
example](raweb1.html#bib-lswprep), indicating the `doi=` is the same as
the `xxurl`, without the xx.

### 2.8 Bibliography {#rabib}

#### 2.8.1 Bibliography: the raweb case {#rabib1}

There are three bibliography files for the raweb: `miaou2003.bib`,
`miaou_foot2003.bib`, and `miaou_refer2003.bib`.

A reference from the main file miaou2003.bib appears in the bibliography
if it is cited via `\cite` (there is an example [line
122](raweb1.html#122)) or via `\nocite` (example [line
246](raweb1.html#246)) or if the `\nocite{*}` has been issued (example
[line 20](raweb1.html#020)). The example file contains an instance of
each of the standard bibtex entries, with all the required and optional
fields, named std1 to std13, with two famous authors. The main
bibliography should contain only references of the Team in the current
year. Since 2013, this file is automatically generated.

Entries from miaou_refer2003.bib can be referred to via `\cite` or
`\refercite`, there is an implicit `\nocite{*}`, so that the whole
database is included. The miaou_refer2003.bib should contain the ten
most important published papers (or books) of the team.

Reference to other bibliography entries (not from the team, not from the
current year, or not one of the most important publications of the team)
can be made, provided that the entry is in miaou_foot2003.bib, and you
use the command `\footcite` (there is an example [line
122](raweb1.html#122)).

#### 2.8.2 Bibliography: the general case {#rabib2}

Normally, you say `\cite{foo,bar}`, and this makes two references to
some bibliographic entries, defined by `\bibitem{foo}` and
`\bibitem{bar}`. Very often, an external program, bibtex, is used to
compute the list of these `\bibitem` and their content, using the
argument of the `\bibliography` command as the list of the database
files to look at. The output of bibtex is put in the file miaou2003.bbl,
it contains essentially one `thebibliography` environment (more than one
in the raweb case), and lots of `\bibitem{foo}` commands. The content of
these is defined by the current bibliography style, the value of the
argument of the `\bibliographystyle` command.

The default behavior of *Tralics* is not to call bibtex, but to compute
and translate an intermediate file, say `miaou2003_.bbl` (note the
underscore), that is equivalent to the miaou2003.bbl file produced by
bibtex. It contains no `thebibliography` environment, but a lot of
`\citation` commands (that are in reality environments, since they are
explicitly terminated by an `\endcitation` command). This file is
translated (in case of errors while translating the bibliography, line
numbers refer to this file). An example is given under `` `\citation ``
\<doc-c.html\#cmd-citation\>\`\_\_.

The result is independent of any bibliographystyle. It contains commands
of the form `\cititem{btitle}{title of the book}`. If the command
`\cititem-btitle` is defined, it will be called with `title of the book`
as argument. It can also contain commands as `\bauteurs` and
`\beditors`, that take as argument a list of `\bpers` commands. All
these commands can be redefined, they are independent of commands used
elsewhere.

The bibliography is translated at the end of the run, when the list of
all citations is found. The result is a `<biblio>` element (the name can
be changed, via the configuration file, using something like xml_biblio
= \"Biblio\"). This element is inserted in the XML tree at the end. If
you use the `\bibliography` command, the first occurrence of it defines
the location (bibtex complains if more than one `\bibliography` is
issued, but *Tralics* is happy with more than one). You can also use
`\insertbibliohere`, this command has precedence over everything else.

Assume that the configuration file contains a line with bibtex_fields =
\"firstpage lastpage\". The effect of this line is to tell *Tralics* to
read also the fields `firstpage` and `lastpage` and to include them in
the bbl file as `\cititem{firstpage}{50}`. If the configuration file
contains also bibtex_extension = \"foo bar\" then entry types `foo` and
`bar` are recognised, together with the standard types.

#### 2.8.3 Bibliography: extended syntax {#rabib3}

The mechanism explained in §2.8.1 above works by extending the syntax of
the `\cite` command. It takes three arguments type (optional), prenote
(optional) and keys (a comma separated list of keys) for instance
`\cite[foo][bar]{gee1, gee2}`. If only one optional argument is given,
it is prenote. The translation is a sequence of
`<cit><ref>   </ref></cit>` elements, one for each key.

The three commands `\footcite`, `\yearcite` and `\refercite` do not read
a type but assume it is, respectively, `foot`, `year` and `refer`. In
the case of `\footcite`, the first `<cite>` is preceded by the value of
`\footcitepre` (that does nothing by default). See also
[\\yearcite](doc-y.html#cmd-yearcite),
[\\refercite](doc-r.html#cmd-refercite) and
[\\footcite](doc-f.html#cmd-footcite). The commands `\yearcite` and
`\refercite` were introduced in version 2.8 of *Tralics*, while
`\footcite` is inspired from the footcite package by Eric Domenjoud. The
command `\nocite` is similar, but it takes no prenote. Its translation
is empty. A special key is `*`; in this case a global variable is set
(meaning that the whole bibliography data base should be included). The
command `\natcite` command takes three optional arguments nat-type,
prenote, postnote. Translation is one `<Cit>` element, containing one
`<ref>` per key.

If type is `year`, it will be replaced by an empty value; if type is
`refer` and DRY (see below) is false, it will be replaced as well. An
auxiliary command is then applied to each key. For instance
`\cite[year][aa]{r1,r2}` is converted into
`\cite@one {}{r1}{aa}\citepunct \cite@one {}{r2}{}` (the first empty
argument is the converted type type), and `\footcite[bar]{gee1, gee2}`
is converted into
`\footcitepre \cite@one {foot}{gee1}{bar}\footcitesep \cite@one   {foot}{gee2}{}`
(the first command, by default does nothing). Finally,
`\natcite[aa][bb][cc]{r1,r2}` is converted to
`\NAT@open bb \cite@simple {r1}\NAT@sep \cite@simple {r2}\NAT@cmt   cc\NAT@close \endnatcite`;
this uses some commands defined by the natbib.plt package. Translation
is
`<Cit type='aa'>(bb <ref   target='bid0'/>;<ref target='bid1'/>,   cc)</Cit>`.
The purpose of the `\endnat` token is to finish the `<Cit>` element.
Translation of `\cite{xx}` is `<cit><ref target='bid8'/></cit>`.

Let\'s explain the commands `\cite@simp{key}` and
`\cite@one{type}{val}{key}`. They first generate a cite key, formed of
the type, the string "cite:" and the key, for instance `footcite:gee2`.
A unique identifier (for instance `bid1`) is associated to the key. If
the identifier does not exists, the reference is marked to be solved; it
is an error if `\cite` is called after *Tralics* has started translating
the bibliography (for instance, you cannot use the command in a
bibliography file). In the case of `\nocite` no further action is taken;
otherwise a reference is created, of the form `<ref target='bid1'/>`. In
the case of `\cite@simp`, this element is inserted in the XML tree, and
no further action is taken. Otherwise, the translation of the second
argument becomes the content of the element. A new paragraph is started
if necessary, and a `<cit>` element is inserted in the current XMl tree;
its value is the `<ref>` element. It may have three attribute:
`rend='type'` (where the value of the attribute is the type), `type='w'`
(in case `\def\cite@@type{w}` has been executed), and `prenote='xx'` (in
case `\def\cite@prenote{xx}` has been executed).

One task of *Tralics* is to solve the citations, this means, for every
cite key, for instance `footcite:gee2` with unique id `bid1`, there is a
unique element whose id attribute is bid1. There are different ways, see
below. After the whole document is translated, *Tralics* checks if there
are unsolved citations. If so, it translates the bibliography. After
that, for unsolved citations, an error is signaled of the form *Error
signaled while handling entry footcite:gee2 undefined reference*. The
`\bibliography` command specifies the list of data files to consider. In
the case of `torture+foot` (assuming there is no file torture+foo.bib)
the file torture.bib is read, and `footcite:gee2` is solved by a
reference whose key is gee2. In the case of the raweb, for instance for
miaou2006, there are three bibliography files miaou2006.bib (should
contain all references of the year 2006 of the team),
miaou_refer2006.bib (contains major publications of the team in recent
years) and miaou_foot2006.bib (for everything else). These file solve
entries of type year, refer and foot respectively. It may happen that
*Tralics* moves an entry from one category to the other, withe a message
of the type *entry moved from refer to year* for different reasons.

There is a special hack, DRY (for distinguish-refer-year) introduced in
version 2.8. If *Tralics* is called with the switch
-distinguish_refer_in_rabib=false, then DRY mode is set to false (see
details in [Options of the program](options.html#drir)). It is true by
default. If DRY is true, you can put the same entry (with the same key,
and the same value) in both files miaou2006.bib and miaou_refer2006.bib.
This is however not recommended.

#### 2.8.4 Bibliography: more hacks {#rabib4}

There are different ways to put solve an entry. For instance
`\xbox {foo} {\XMLsolvecite [] [foot] {toto} {text}}` (see
[\\XMLsolvecite](doc-x.html#cmd-XMLsolvecite)) solves the entry
associated to `\footcite{toto}`. You can also use `\bibitem[xx]{toto]`
(see [\\bibitem](doc-b.html#cmd-bibitem)), that solves the entry with a
`<citation>` element. You can ask *Tralics* to generate the
bibliography, or use an external program that get all data from one or
more bibliography databases. Note: you must use the -shell-escape
argument of *Tralics* in order to execute an external program.

*Tralics* interprets the argument of the `\bibliographystyle` command as
follows. If it is `bibtex:foo`, this means that `bibtex testb` is
executed; if it is `program:cat`, this means that the program
`cat testb.aux` will be executed. In all other cases, it defines the
style to be used (default is plain). This command can be used more then
once: first to define the style, second to define the command; note that
`bibtex:foo` sets the style to foo, and `bibtex:` uses the defined
style. We assume here that testb is the name of the document to
translate. Example

::: {.container .ltx-source}
:

    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
    \AtEndDocument{\bibitem{unused}Hey}
    \bibliography{torture}
    \bibliographystyle{bibtex:}
    \cite{poussin,cruz,many,strange,unused}
    \end{document}
:::

If an external program is given, a minimal auxiliary file is created,
named, testb.aux, containing

::: {.container .ltx-source}
:

    \citation{poussin}
    \citation{cruz}
    \citation{many}
    \citation{strange}
    \bibstyle{plain}
    \bibdata{torture}
:::

It is assumed that the external program generates a file named
testb.bbl; this is obviously not the case for `cat testb.aux`. This file
is loaded (if possible) and executed. It is assumed that translating
this file will solve all entries, but no further checks are done.

If no external program is given, *Tralics* will read the database files,
and construct a bbl file (named `testb_.bbl`) and executes it. Given the
following command
`\newcommand \usebib[2] {\bibliography{#1#2, #1_foot#2+foot, #1_refer#2+refer}}`,
you can say `\usebib{miaou}{2003}`, if you want to mimic what *Tralics*
does for the RA2003. (note: only suffixes year, foot and refer are
considered; this could be generalized).

#### 2.8.5 Bibliography: reducing entropy {#rabib5}

A new feature was introduced in 2006, it allows the use of a single data
base instead of three different ones. This means that you can provide
miaou_all2006.bib instead of three files. This feature is incompatible
with the idea that one of the three files is automatically generated. An
entry in the file has type year, foot or refer, if it is cited by
`\yearcite`, `\footcite` or `\refercite` or `\nocite` with the
corresponding flag.

When *Tralics* reads the file miaou_all2006.bib, and sees an entry, say
\`Knuth\', it considers it as solving `\cite{Knuth}`,
`\refercite{Knuth}` or `\footcite{Knuth}`. In general, a single
alternative is chosen, but as explained above, it is allowed to use both
`\cite{Knuth}` and `\refercite{Knuth}`.

What happens if you say `\nocite{*}`? One possibility would be to insert
the whole data base thrice (as foot, refer and year), a second
possibility would be to insert it once, but not as year, neither as
refer. Hence, the only logical solution: the behavior is the same as
before version 2.9.3. If you say `\nocite{*}`, all entries from
miaou2006.bib are included, by defaut all entries from
miaou_refer2006.bib are included. As a consequence, an entry from
miaou_foot2006.bib or miaou_all2006.bib is included only if explicitly
cited. This can be done via `\nocite[foot]{Knuth}` or
`\nocite[refer]{Knuth}` if the reference should have type \`foot\' or
\`refer\'.

Important note. Assume that you say `\cite{Knuth}` and
`\footcite{knuth}`, but no other variants like KNUTH of KNuth, etc. It
is possible to have two files miaou2006.bib and miaou_foot2006.bib with
the entry \`Knuth\'. When the second data base is read, then \`Knuth\'
will solve \`knuth\' (assuming that the data base does not contain any
variants like KNUTH, etc.) However, if you merge these two files in a
single one, you will be in trouble: \`Knuth\' will solve `\cite{Knuth}`,
and no tentative is made for variants; in this case the data base must
contain \`knuth\' that solves `\footcite{knuth}`.

3. Running the programs {#run0}
-----------------------

Options to the *Tralics* program can be found on a [separate
page](options.html). Some of them have been removed in 2008, there
description can be found [here](raweb4.html), where we explain the
different strategies that could be used to produce the Raweb before
2008.

You have the following choices:

1.  You are not interested in the raweb, and you just say tralics
    myfile. This produces a beautiful XML document.
2.  You do not have tralics on your machine: you run latex (bibtex,
    dvips, etc) on your TeX document. The gives a dvi or PS version of
    your document (with \`draft\' on each page in the case of the
    Raweb).
3.  You can say tralics -check. This will check the syntax, and produce
    a transcript file, and nothing more.
4.  You can say tralics myfile -ps. This is more or less the combination
    of the two previous options. However, the order of the modules might
    be changed. This generates a PostScript file with the Inria Logo on
    it.
5.  You can say tralics myfile -myoptions. This produces a beautiful XML
    document, and more. For instance, if you tralics -xmltex, you will
    get a pdf file, provided that all files and scripts are available on
    your machine (normally, everything should be included in the raweb
    package, contact maintainers of this package in case of problem).

Since 2008, all these funny options have been removed, and *Tralics*
just produces the XML file.

### 3.1 Options of the program

Options of the program are available on a [separate page](options.html).

### 3.2 Running latex

You can run latex on the file. This works provided that the raweb class
file is available (until 2006). This is the first run

The result is the following
`miaou2003.ps </pdf/miaou2003.ps>`{.interpreted-text role="download"}.
There are two sections \`New results\' (section 6 and 8), because there
is a module in section \`new results\' after a module in section
\`Contracts\'. This explains why LaTeX sees multiply-defined labels.
There is an: Overfull \\hbox (22.7474pt too wide) in paragraph at lines
19\--19. Line 19 contains the `\maketitle` command. The overfull box
contains the long name of the Team. It is hard to remove it. Note: this
is a draft version. You should not try to add commands that remove
overfull and underfull boxes, this is completely useless.

### 3.3 Running Tralics

When you run *Tralics*, whatever the arguments, it will print the
following lines. The third line (`Starting XX processing for YYY` may
change).

:::

We already explained the messages about singular/plural in the
`participant` environment. The preprocessor has seen 63 environments (5
`motscle`, 5 `catperso`, 9 `participant`, 28 `module`, and some others,
namely one `moreinfo,` one `glossaire`, one `array`, one `figure`, two
`description`, two `equation`, and 8 `itemize`). The total number of
keywords is 19, the number of `\pers` commands is 34. They were two
declared topics, and the last line indicates the number of modules per
section.

You can run tralics with option -check. In this case, the program checks
the syntax, prints some information, and that\'s all.

### 3.4 Running Tralics -ps

Let\'s try tralics -ps miaou2003. The effect of this command is to check
the source file, re-arrange the modules in the right order, and call
LaTeX. The ps option is not supported anymore in the 2008 version.

From the input file miaou2003.tex another source file miaou.tex (whose
content is given [here](raweb2.html)) is created. Essentially, it is the
initial file, with the modules in the right order; commands like
`\begin{module}` are replaced by
`\RAstartmodule{1} {MIAOU} {6} {tralics}{...}` (the first number is the
topics, the second number is the section). The document class is
`raweb`.

This file is compiled by an external program, launched directly by
*Tralics* some years ago, a Perl script later on. On some systems the
latex command does not recognize the -interaction switch, and you have
to say something like /mypath/mylatex \\nonstopmodeinput{thefile}. For
these reasons, the names of the command to execute is not built-in, but
in the configuration file. We assume that the relevant lines are:

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    makefo="xsltproc --catalogs -o %A.fo %B %C";
    makehtml = "xsltproc --catalogs  %B %C";
    call_lint = "xmllint --catalogs --valid  --noout %C"
    makepdf = "pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode %w"
    generatedvi = "latex -interaction=nonstopmode %t"
    generateps = "dvips %t.dvi -o %t.ps"
:::

These lines are copied in the file user_param.pl and the Perl script
rahandler.pl is called on it (there is a command line option that allows
the use of another program). In the example that follows, there are
lines of the form todo_something=x. They correspond to the options of
tralics. Here ps is set to true, this explains that the script must call
latex on the file apics.tex. Here html is set to false, true would mean
that conversion from apics.xml to apics.html is required.

::: {#user-param .container .ltx-source}
    $::makefo='xsltproc --catalogs -o %A.fo %B %C';
    $::makehtml='xsltproc --catalogs  %B %C';
    $::checkxml='xmllint --catalogs --valid  --noout %C';
    $::makepdf='pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode %w';
    $::makedvi='';
    $::dvitops='';
    $::generate_dvi='latex -interaction=nonstopmode %t';
    $::generate_ps='dvips %t.dvi -o %t.ps';
    $::tralics_dir='/user/grimm/home/cvs/tralics';

The result is the following `miaou.ps </pdf/miaou.ps>`{.interpreted-text
role="download"}.

There is one warning: Underfull \\vbox (badness 10000) has occurred
while \\output is active. Tracing TeX shows the following. The selected
breakpoint at end of page 7 has: t=151.71101 plus 4.88531, g=200.427
(here g is the size of the page, minus the size of the image, and t the
size of the text, the big difference between t and g explains the
underfull box). There is no page break between the title of module 6.2
and the first line of the text. There is possible page break between
this line and the start of 6.3. Parameters are t=201.6997 plus 12.54138
minus 0.94266 and g=200.427. This pagebreak is not chosen because it
would overflow by 0.33pt! Adding a bit of shrinkability to the parskip,
for instance `\parskip =0pt plus 1pt minus 1pt`, is enough in this case.
But, remember: this is not the final document.

In case of errors, latex may complain, for instance as "Undefined
control sequence". In this case, you will see something like "exit
status of latex is 256". A zero status is OK, a non-zero one means an
error. If your code contains `\def\foobar{0\foobar}\foobar`, you will
overflow TeX\'s memory. However, if you remove the 0, you will go in an
endless loop. If you kill the process, normally, this will kill the Perl
script, and the latex process. After that, you will have to debug (add
`\tracingall` somewhere, and look at the transcript file, its name is
miaou.log)

:::

You can see that the Perl script has been called. It is configurated to
call a XSLT processor twice (producing a file miaou.fo, or a bunch of
HTML files), then calling pdflatex twice, then xmllint. In fact nothing
is done.

You could try tralics apics2006 -xmllint. No error is signaled: the file
apics2006.tex that we use to check the tools produces correct output!
You could try tralics miaou2003 -xmllint. The answer is that the
document produced by *Tralics* does not conform the DTD, because the
module starting at [line 201](raweb1.html#201) contains no text; in
reality, xmllint says the following:

::: {.container .tty_out}
    miaou.xml:152: element module: validity error : Element module content does 
    not follow the DTD, expecting (head , (moreinfo | keywords | participant |

If you say tralics miaou2003 -xmltex, you will see the following.

anything else. Timings for apics 2006: Tralics 0.1 s, Latex 0.5s, Pdf

4. The auxiliary perl script {#script0}
----------------------------

Before 2008, an auxiliary Perl script was used for the Raweb.The
behavior of *Tralics* is not the same in Raweb mode or in normal mode.
Raweb mode if entered if the document type (deduced from the options,
the configuration file, and the document) is `RA` (or `ra`). In the
case, the file name should be apics2006.tex, and the document class
should be `ra2006` (the year can be replaced by 2004, etc, provided that
it is the same). If an XML file is created, it will be apics.xml and the
year will be an attribute of the document element. If a TeX file is
created, it will be named apics.tex, and it will use the `raweb`
documentclass.

-   If you say tralics apics2006 -check, the software will read your
    file, analyze it and, that\'s all (the transcript file is
    apics2006.log).
-   If you say tralics apics2006 -ps, the software will read your file,
    analyze it, create a new TeX file, and use an external program to
    compile it; communication is via a file named user_param.pl. The
    file apics.rh.log will hold the logs of all the external programs
    (apics2006.log is the transcript file of *Tralics*, apics.log the
    transcript file of LaTeX).
-   If you say tralics apics2006, the software will read your file,
    analyze it, and translate it. It will call the external program, but
    nothing will happen.
-   If you say tralics apics2006 -xmlall (or some other options) the
    software will read your file, analyze it, and translate it. It will
    call the external program, that will convert the XML file. As above,
    communication is via user_param.pl, transcript in apics.rh.log.

The auxiliary script starts like this

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    #!/usr/bin/perl
    # additional header info here
    print "(C) 2004 2006 INRIA, Jos\\'e Grimm, Team Apics\n";
:::

All variables used by the program can be redefined by the \`require\' at
the end of the file. If `todo_ps` is true (non-zero), then you want a
preview (conversion from latex to dvi and Postscript). Otherwise, if
`todo_xml` is true, you want conversion from latex to XML; this is done
by *Tralics*. The post-processor allows you to check the XML (if
`todo_lint` is true), convert it to HTML (if `todo_html` is true), to
XMLFO (if `todo_fo` is true), and to Pdf or Postscript (if `todo_tex` is
true). The variables are initialized like this.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    $::todo_fo = 1;
    $::todo_html = 1;
    $::todo_tex = 1;
    $::todo_lint = 1;
    $::todo_ps = 0;
    $::todo_xml = 1;
:::

If you run *Tralics* on the file apics2006.tex, the preview will be in
the file apics.tex (from the variable `tex_file`), while the XML file
will be apics.xml (from the variable `no_year`). And the year is 2006.
Other variable contain a percent sign. Make sure that Perl does not
interpret them as a hash reference, since we will modify them later.
([explanations here](#percent)).

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    # Predeclare all variables here.
    $::tralics_dir= "/user/grimm/home/cvs/tralics";
    $::ra_year = "2006";
    $::tex_file = "miaou";
    $::no_year = "miaou";
    $::generate_dvi = q/latex -interaction=nonstopmode %t/;
    $::generate_ps = q/dvips %t.dvi -o %t.ps/;
    $::makefo = 'xsltproc --catalogs -o %A.fo %B %C';
    $::makehtml ='xsltproc --catalogs  %B %C';
    $::makepdf = 'pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode %w';
    $::makedvi = 'latex -interaction=nonstopmode %w';
    $::dvitops = 'dvips %w.dvi -o %w.ps';
    $::checkxml = 'xmllint --catalogs --valid  --noout %C';

    $::dtd_file = "raweb3.dtd"; # New in 2004.
:::

The variables shown above are overwritten by the content of the
user_param.pl, an example is [given here](raweb4.html#user-param). In
particuler, the user-param file must give the name of the TeX file, and
`tralics_dir`, the location where additional files are located.

### 4.1 Postscript mode

The objective is easy to understand: we have to call latex three times,
then dvips; after the first call, we execute bibtex. Three auxiliary
file are needed for bibtex: one is created by the footbib package, and
one by the script. The last one is standard.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub copy_and_exec {
      print "copy-and-exec for $::tex_file\n";
      link_some_files();
      open OUTFILE, ">$::no_year.refer.aux";
      print OUTFILE "\\bibstyle{rawebnum}\n";
      print OUTFILE "\\citation{*}\n";
      print OUTFILE "\\bibdata{$::no_year" . "_refer" . $::ra_year . "}\n";
      close OUTFILE;
      open LOGFILE, ">$::no_year.rh.log";
      call_latex();
      call_bibtex ("","");
      call_bibtex (".refer","_refer");
      call_bibtex (".fb","_foot");
      call_latex();
      call_latex();
      interpret_and_launch($::generate_ps,"junk",1,"dvips","");
      close LOGFILE;
      print "(Transcript written on $::no_year.rh.log)\n";
      print "done\n";
    }
:::

This is an auxiliary routine that takes 5 arguments. The first one is a
string to be evaluated (as explained below), it comes from the
configuration file; the second argument is either \`junk\', or the name
of a xslt file, it can be used by the evaluator of the argument. Then
comes a boolean, if false nothing is done. Argument number four is a
symbolic name of the command, and if the last argument is true, the
command is executed twice.

If you do not want to generate PS, just put the empty string in
`$::generate_ps`, because here, nothing is done if `$template` is empty.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub interpret_and_launch {
      my ($template,$aux,$tr,$name,$twice) = @_;
      $_ = $template;
      return unless $_;
      interpret_str($aux);
      launch_cmd($_,$tr,$name);
      launch_cmd($_,$tr,$name) if $twice;
    }
:::

This launches latex.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub call_latex {
      interpret_and_launch($::generate_dvi,"junk",1,"latex",0);
      copy_to_log("$::no_year.log");
    }
:::

This launches bibtex. We do not use the `interpret_str` subroutine (if
your executable is called BibTex, just edit the Perl script). There are
three bibtex files, apics2006.bib, apics_foot2006.bib and
apics_refer2006.bib. The procedure gets \`apics\' from `$::no_year`, the
\`2006\' from `$::ra_year`, and what is between as second argument. The
bibliography files are optional, so nothing is done in case the files do
not exist. On the other hand, the auxiliary files have the same name as
in section 3.1, without the year. For instance, it would be
apics.fb.aux. The quantity between \`apics\' and \`aux\' is the first
argument.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub call_bibtex {
      my ($exta, $extb) = @_;
      my ($bib);
      $bib = "$::no_year$extb$::ra_year.bib";
      return unless -f $bib;
      $_ = $::no_year . $exta;
      print "bibtex -min-crossrefs=1000 $_\n";
      print LOGFILE "result of bibtex $_\n";
      `bibtex -min-crossrefs=1000 $_`;
      print "bibtex exit status $?\n";
      print LOGFILE "bibtex exit status $?\n";
      copy_to_log("$_.blg");
    }
:::

This allows us to merge the transcript files of the different processes.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub copy_to_log  {
      my($file) = @_;
      open(INPUT,"<$file");
      while (<INPUT>) {
        print LOGFILE;
      };
      close INPUT;
    }
:::

This executes the first argument if the second is true. Everything
printed on the screen is also copied in the transcript file. Note: *this
means that all messages of LaTeX are stored in a buffer and printed at
end of job*. Said otherwise, in case of trouble, you will see the error
messages only after you abort the job.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub launch_cmd {
      my ($cmd,$test,$name) = @_;
      if(! $test) {
        print LOGFILE "(not done) $cmd\n";
        print  "(not done) $cmd\n";
        return;
      }
      print LOGFILE "$cmd\n";
      print "$cmd\n";
      print LOGFILE "-------------------------\nStart trace of $name\n";
      my $value;
      $value = `$cmd`;
      print LOGFILE $value;
      print $value;
      print LOGFILE "End trace of $name\n-------------------------\n";
      print LOGFILE "exit status of $name is $?\n";
      print "exit status of $name is $?\n";
    }
:::

The raweb directory of *Tralics* contains a lot of useful files. What we
do here is to put a symbolic link for the following files: the three bst
files, the class file, and the two logos (in PostScript and Pdf form).

Todo. Some files depend on the year, and other do not. In particular,
raweb.cls and raweb.bst depend on the year. The class file contains the
current year for headings, name of logo, name of foot bibliography, the
bst file output warnings in case of a bad year. The name \`raweb.bst\'
comes from the class file, this is easy to change, but the name of the
document class is generated by Tralics.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub link_some_files {
      link_src ("rawebalpha.bst");
      link_src ("raweb.bst");
      link_src ("rawebnum.bst");
      link_src ("raweb.cls");
      link_src ("Logo-INRIA-couleur.pdf");
      link_src ("Logo-INRIA-couleur.ps");
      link_src ("LogoRA" . $::ra_year . ".eps");
      link_src ("LogoRA" . $::ra_year . ".pdf");
    }
:::

This takes three arguments, A, B and C. The effect is to make a symbolic
link from file A in the source directory, in the directory B, to file C.
Nothing is done if the target exists, or if the source does not exists.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub link_file {
       my($in,$out,$short_in);
       $in = @_[0]; $out = @_[1]; $short_in = @_[2];
       $in = "$::raweb_dir/$in";
       `ln -s $in $out` if (-f $in && !-f "$out/$short_in");
    }
:::

Same as above, but B (the directory in which is put the link) is the
current directory.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub link_src {
       my($in,$out,$short_in);
       $short_in =@_[0];
        $in = "$::tralics_dir/raweb/$short_in";
       `ln -s $in` if (-f $in && !-f "$short_in");
    }
:::

Some other files come from the xml directory of *Tralics*, and neeed a
different function.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub link_xml {
       my($in,$out,$short_in);
       $short_in =@_[0];
       $in = "$::tralics_dir/xml/$short_in";
       `ln -s $in` if (-f $in && !-f "$short_in");
    }
:::

### 4.2 XML mode

This is done in XML mode. Note that *Tralics* creates a file named
\_hyperref.cfg that contains useful information. On the other hand, the
hyperref.cfg file is used by the hyperref package. For this reason, we
are a bit careful, when copying.

The script constructs also a TeX file, that reads the XML file (value of
`\xmlfile`). This file loads the xmltex.tex package (by Carlisle)
explicitly, and the fotex.xmt (by Rahtz) implicitly, according to some
obscure rules. There are some scheduling problems; as a consequence, the
file wapics.cfg loads the MathML stuff. The fotex.cfg file is loaded
much too late (it is needed however, since it explains how to insert the
Logo on the front page).

After these files are created, all the shell scripts are run.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub exec_xml {
      if(!($::todo_html || $::todo_fo || $::todo_tex || $::todo_lint) ) {
        print "Postprocessor did nothing\n";
        return;
      }
      print "exec-xml for $::tex_file\n";
      link_xml_files();# links files, for instance fotex.cfg 
      make_icons();# for HTML 
      if(-f "_hyperref.cfg") { # keywords and such 
        `rm hyperref.cfg`  if(-f "hyperref.cfg");
        `mv _hyperref.cfg hyperref.cfg`;
      }
      my $name1 = "w" . $::no_year . ".cfg";
      my $name2 = $::tralics_dir . "raweb-cfg.sty";
      `rm $name1` if -f $name1;
      `ln -s $name2 $name1` if -f $name2;
      make_catalog();
      open OUTFILE, ">w$::no_year.tex";
      print OUTFILE "\\def\\xmlfile{$::no_year.fo}\n";
      print OUTFILE "\\def\\LastDeclaredEncoding{T1}\n";
      print OUTFILE "\\input{xmltex.tex}\n";
      print OUTFILE "\\end{document}\n";
      close OUTFILE;

      open LOGFILE, ">$::no_year.rh.log";
      if($::todo_html) {
        `rm -rf $::no_year$::ra_year`;   # a bit aggressive? ;
        `mkdir $::no_year$::ra_year`;
      }
      interpret_and_launch($::makefo,"raweb3fo", $::todo_fo,"makefo",0);
      interpret_and_launch($::makehtml,"rawebhtml", $::todo_html,"makehtml",0);
      interpret_and_launch($::makepdf,"junk", $::todo_tex,"pdflatex",1);
      interpret_and_launch($::makedvi,"junk", $::todo_tex,"latex",1);
      interpret_and_launch($::dvitops,"junk", $::todo_tex,"dvips",0);
      interpret_and_launch($::checkxml,"junk", $::todo_lint,"lint",0);
      close LOGFILE;
      print "(Transcript written on $::no_year.rh.log)\n";
      print "done\n";
    }
:::

Obtaining the Pdf from the XML requires the same logos. It also needs a
hook: this is fotex.cfg. We also make sure that the DTD is visible.
Maybe, we should have a raweb2004.dtd ?

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub link_xml_files {
      link_xml ($::dtd_file);
      link_xml ("fotex.cfg");
      link_xml ("fotex.sty");
      link_xml ("fotex.sty");
      link_xml ("raweb-uni.sty");
      link_xml ("fotex-add.sty");
      link_src ("Logo-INRIA-couleur.pdf");
      link_src ("Logo-INRIA-couleur.ps");
      link_src ("LogoRA" . $::ra_year . ".eps");
      link_src ("LogoRA" . $::ra_year . ".pdf");
    }
:::

This routine creates a icons directory and links some files. The names
of the icons that are needed can be found in the different styles
sheets. Note that the HTML files are put in a directory below the
current directory, so that it accesses them via ../icons/xx.png. As a
result, if you call the script with different teams, the icons directory
will be shared. This is only useful if you generate HTML.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub make_icons {
      `mkdir icons` unless -d "icons";
      link_file ("icons/contents_motif.png", "icons", "contents_motif.png");
      # more lines omitted
    }
:::

The `make_catalog` routine copies the file catalog.src (found in the
source directory) into the file named catalog. However, it does not
overwrite it. The string `source_directory` is replaced by the source
directory (check for `$ENV` at the end of the script).

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub make_catalog {
      return if -f "catalog";
      my $src_name = $::tralics_dir . "catalog.src";
      open(INPUT,"<$src_name");
      my(@file_string);
      while (<INPUT>) {
        push(@file_string, $_ );
      };
      $_ = join('',@file_string);
      return unless $_;
      s!source_directory/dtd/!$::tralics_dir/xml/!g;
      s!source_directory/xml/!$::tralics_dir/xml/!g;
      open OUTFILE, ">catalog";
      print OUTFILE;
      close OUTFILE;
    }
:::

This is a very complicated procedure, whose purpose is to produce a file
with the following two lines

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    PUBLIC "mathml" /user/grimm/home/cvs/tralics/xml/mathml2/mathml2.dtd
    PUBLIC "teixlite" "/user/grimm/home/cvs/tralics/xml/teixlite.dtd" 
:::

### 4.3 Evaluation of parameters

We have seen that the configuration file of *Tralics* contains lines
like: `makefo="xsltproc --catalogs -o %A.fo %B %C";`. These lines are
copied verbatim in the user_param.pl file (with single quotes instead of
double quotes). The lines are evaluated according to the following rules

-   %A and %a are replaced by \`apics\' (the name of the team),
-   %B and %b are replaced by the value of the argument (in the source
    directory), with, or without the `.xsl` extension.
-   %C and %c are replaced by \`apics\' (the name of the team), with and
    without the `.xml` suffix,
-   %W and %w are replaced by \`wapics\' (team name, with an initial w),
    with and without the `.tex` suffix,
-   %T and %t are replaced by \`apics\' (alternate team name) with and
    without the `.tex` suffix.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    sub interpret_str {
      my $B = @_[0];
      my ($Y,$S,$P) = ($::no_year,$::raweb_dir_src,$::tex_file);
      # hack here in case replacement contains %
      s/%A/$Y/g;
      s/%a/$Y/g;
      s/%B/$S$B.xsl/g;
      s/%b/$S$B/g;
      s/%C/$Y.xml/g;
      s/%c/$Y/g;
      s/%W/w$Y.tex/g;

:::

### 4.4 End of rahandler.pl

The rahandler.pl file contains all variables and procedures shown above,
maybe in a different order. The action of the script is given here. This
read the user parameters (created by Tralics, possibly modified by the
user). Since the file is read by \`require\' it should terminate with
something that does not evaluate to zero.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    require "user_param.pl";
:::

It is important to export the catalog. It is also important to export
the `TEXMFCNF` variable. For security reasons, it is better not to put
this in the current directory. On the other hand, you need a huge
pdflatex when reading XML.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    $ENV{SGML_CATALOG_FILES}= "./catalog";   
    $ENV{TEXMFCNF} = "$::tralics_dir" . "/xml:"
       . ( defined($ENV{TEXMFCNF}) ? "$ENV{TEXMFCNF}" : "");
:::

Action.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    if($::todo_ps) { copy_and_exec(); }
    elsif ($::todo_xml) { exec_xml(); }
:::

5. The raweb-cfg.sty file {#fotex}
-------------------------

The pdf files of the activity report are produced via a Makefile as
follows. The TeX source is converted by *Tralics* into some XML file; an
XML processor converts this into another XML file, conforming to the new
DTD (whatever this means). Another XML processor converts the result
into XSL/FO format, which is interpreted by TeX via the tools of S.
Rahtz and D. Carlisle.

### 5.1 Details

Some patches to these files are required. We explain here the content of
the file raweb-cfg.sty. It starts like this.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \makeatletter
    \immediate\write20{Loading mathml support and raweb extensions}
    % patch of xmltex.tex
:::

There are some lines that try to solve the problem: how to put an &
character in an URL, i.e. in an attribute. See
[here](raweb3.html#ampersand).

The command `\utfeight@protect@internal` redefines, among other, the
command `\utfeightaz` as
`\def\utfeightaz {\noexpand \utfeightaz \noexpand}`. A more efficient
code would be: `\let \utfeightaz \utfeightaz@jg@int`. See
[here](raweb3.html#added-cmds) the definition of `\utfeightaz@jg@int`
and the like.

We redefine `\utfeight@protect@internal` and `\utfeight@protect@chars`.
Code is given [here](raweb3.html#modified-cmds).

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\utfeight@protect@chars{ source code shown here }
    \begingroup
    \catcode`<\active
    \catcode`&\active
    \gdef\utfeight@protect@internal{ source code shown here}
:::

### 5.2 Ampersands in URL

The problem is that the fotex.fmt file has a declaration like this
`\XMLnamespaceattributeX {fo} {external-destination} {\FOexternaldestination} {}`.
As a result, the property list of the \`fo\' namespace will contain
(among others) the following tokens
`\XML@attrib  0:external-destination\relax \FOexternaldestination {}\utfeight@chardef  \FOexternaldestination`.
In some places, `\XMLattributeX` is called: this defines an attribute
for a single element. In both cases, the X means: call
`\utfeight@chardef`, and these are the only cases where the macro is
used. The X is for \`expand\'; the trouble is that entities cannot be
expanded, and we need a way to inhibit this expansion.

We redefine `\utfeight@chardef` with a little hack for the & character,
as follows. Normally, ampersand is the same as `\XML@amp@markup`. We
change its value locally. Thus, we change the behavior only inside some
attributes.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \gdef\utfeight@chardef#1{%
      \begingroup
      \utfeight@protect@chars
      \let&\XML@amp@markup@jg  % line added
      \xdef\x@temp{#1}%
      \endgroup
      \let#1\x@temp}
:::

Original code was complicated. What we do here is just test if the
argument is \`amp;\' and replace it with an ampersand. We test the value
of the argument by adding \`amp;\' and we look for the string.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\XML@amp@markup@jg#1;{%
      \XML@amp@markup@jgw#1;amp;\@nil}
    \def\XML@amp@markup@jgw#1amp;#2\@nil{%
      \ifx b#2b \XML@amp@markup#1;\else\string&\fi}
:::

### 5.3 MathML

Here we redefine a lot of MathML functions from mathml2.xmt, and add a
great number of other procedures.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    % Is this needed ? we redefine everything here
    %\inputonce{mathml2.xmt}
    % We do not want mathml to be loaded after this file
    \global\expandafter\let\csname xmt:mathml2.xmt\endcsname\@ne
:::

This declares the three namespaces that will be used later in this file.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \DeclareNamespace{m}{http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML}
    \DeclareNamespace{fotex}{http://www.tug.org/fotex}
    \DeclareNamespace{fo}{http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Format}
:::

We declare [here](raweb3.html#string-decls1) and
[here](raweb3.html#string-decls2) some strings via commands of the form
`\XMLstring\att@true<>true</>`. After that, we can test that an
attribute is true with a test like `\ifx\foo\att@true`. Some strings are

When you say `$\bar x$`, the MathML equivalent is
`<mover accent="true"><mi>x</mi>  <mo>&#xAF;</mo></mover>`. When we see
the `<mo>` element, we know that it is an accent because `\notinover` is
no `\relax`. In this case, we have to do something special with the
content. In some cases, we put the content in `\cur@mo@content`, in
other cases, we set `\jg@cur@acc`. For some strange reasons `&lt;`
translates like `\lbra`, we change this.

We can avoid testing against every accent in the following way: If you
want to put a tilde, the XML will contain `<mo>&#x2DC;</mo>`. This is
defined as `\texttildelow` in the file ucharacters.sty. We redefine this
command, so as to define `\jg@cur@acc`. We use two functions, one for
over accents, another one for underaccents.

Translation of `<mover>xy</mover>` uses `\stackrel`, unless it is an

### 5.4 Tables in MathML

Original code tested attribute `class=equation`. Called \`gathered\' in
this case. This uses three global variables: `\GATHER`, `\StartTable`
and `\StartRow`

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \XMLelement{m:mtable}
      {}
      {
      \def\StartTable{1}%

         \begin{array}{*{99}{c}}
      }
      {
        \end{array}
      }
:::

A non trivial question: where the does group start of finish? We
globally define a command `\temp` that is executed just after the
current group. This command defines `\StartRow` to 1 (true), then
executes the argument. Moreover, if `\StartTable` is 0 (first row of the
table) it toggles it to 1; otherwise, it inserts a `\\`, this creates a
new row.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \XMLelement{m:mtr}
     {}
     {\xmlgrab}
     {\ifnum\StartTable=1

      \else
        \gdef\temp{\\\def\StartRow{1}#1}%
      \fi
      \aftergroup\temp}
:::

This piece of code is not complete. It does not handle the multicolumn
case. We construct a `\temp` command as above. If `StartRow` is one, we
toggle to 0, otherwise insert a ampersand (here `\tabcellsep`). We test
also alignments (left, right, center). What is the purpose of the space
after `\hfill`?

Three similar routines. The translation of

is `{\setlength\unitlength{0.4pt}\curve(300,0, 340,100, 380,0)}`. There
is a big hack here. Spaces are defined to be space plus `\ignorespaces`
by xmltex.tex. When the package tries to convert the 340 into a
dimension, via `\mylength=argument\unitlength`, the `\ignorespaces`
gives a *Missing number, treated as zero* error. For this reason, we
redefine `\ignorespaces`.

The translation of `<pic-bigcircle size='A' unitlength='B'/>` should be

command modifies globally `\unitlength`, so that the piece of code given
above modifies `\unitlength`. For this reason, we use another variable,
and use a global assignment.

:::

This should be changed. This evaluates the command (first argument),
with an argument (second argument), using an optional argument which is
one of L, R, and one of T, B, computed from the global variable
`\XML@pos`.

### 5.6 Tables

In the file fotex.sty, tables are implemented via the \`NoTable\'
mechanism. We modify this a bit.

In this piece of code, we do not set `\TableWidth` if the width is
declared auto.

::: {.container .ltx-source}

    \catcode`\:\active

    }
    \catcode`\:12
:::

### 5.7 Getting labels right

The fotex.xmt file defines the behaviour of `<fo:block>`. The action
depends on the context. The action, when entering the block can be
`\FOListBlock` inside a list, `\FOOutputBlock` (inside output) or
`\FOBoxedBlock` in a table, or `\FONormalBlock`. We modified the code of
this command [(complete source here)](raweb3.html#hack-normalblock).

The essential modification is to move the `\FOlabel` after
`\FOvspacebefore`. Thus, in case of page break, the label is near the
text.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \AtBeginDocument{%
    \def\FONormalBlock{%
      \let\@x\relax
      \ifnum\FOTableNesting>0
        ...
      \else
        \ifnum\FOinList>0
          \FOlabel
          ...
        \else
          ...
          \par
           %\FOlabel (deleted here) 
          \Quadding
          \ifFOBlockGrab
            \FOBoxedBlock{\linewidth}%
          \else
            \FOBorderTop
            \ifdim\FOpaddingbefore>\z@
             \vskip\FOpaddingbefore
            \fi
            \FOvspacebefore
            ...
          \fi
          ...
        \fi
        \FOlabel % added here 
        \FOSetFont{normal}%
      \fi
    \@x
    }
    }
:::

The argument of `\FOgeneratePage` is the expansion of `\FOformat`. If it
is, say `A.`, an A followed by a dot, the result will be
`\@Alph{\c@page}.`, with a dot after the page number.

The `\thepage` command is defined as
`\csname @arabic\endcsname \c@page`, and this looks like the `\yFOlabel`
command.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    %\def\FOgeneratePage#1#2\@null{\csname Format-#1\endcsname{\c@page}#2}
    \def\xFOgeneratePage#1#2\@null{\yFOlabel#1#2}
    \def\yFOlabel#1{\csname Format-#1\endcsname{\c@page}}
:::

The macro `\xFOlabel` is the same as the original `\FOlabel` except that
`\yFOlabel` is not expanded: The purpose of `\protected@write` is to
inhibit premature expansion of `\thepage`. Since the code does not use
`\thepage`, lots of reference in the table of contents are wrong.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\xFOlabel{%
     \ifx\@empty\FOid\else
      \@bsphack
      \protected@write\@mainaux{\let\yFOlabel\relax}%
        {\string\newlabel{\FOid}{{}{\expandafter\xFOgeneratePage
                \FOformat\@null}{}{\FOid}{}}}%
      \@esphack
      \hyper@@anchor{\FOid}{\relax}%
      \global\let\FOid\@empty
     \fi
    }
:::

### 5.8 The title page

If you say `\ra@atxy(70mm,174mm){xx}`, then xx is typeset in a box,
shifted by 70mm horizontally and 174mm vertically, and added to the box
`\ra@atxybox`.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \newbox\ra@atxybox
    \def\ra@atxy(#1,#2)#3{\global\setbox\ra@atxybox=\hbox
     {\unhbox\ra@atxybox
      \vtop to 0pt{\kern #2\hbox to 0pt{\kern #1\relax #3\hss}\vss}}}
:::

The idea is to put the content of the `\ra@atxybox` box at the origin.
We have to modify the `\output` routine, and the easiest way is to
change `\@texttop`, which does nothing (it could be used to implement
`\raggedtop`). The expansion is some material that is put at upper left
corner of the page, before headings are added. This means that we have
to shift the material, inserting some kerns. Note that `\@themargin` is
correct only if the page is odd, or if left and right margins are the
same. The logo appears on only one page, because we kill `\@texttop`.
Note: The raweb.cls file inserts a logo on a given page by adding
`\setbox255=\vbox{\@usemyatxy \unvbox255}` in front of the `\output`
routine. The `\@usemyatxy` command is similar to the command given here.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\ra@useatxy{{%
      \let\@themargin\oddsidemargin
      \vtop to 0pt{\kern-\headsep \kern-\topmargin \kern-\headheight
                   \kern-1in \kern-\voffset
        \hbox to 0pt{\kern-\@themargin \kern-1in \kern-\hoffset
        \unhbox\ra@atxybox \hss}\vss}}%
        \global\let\@texttop\relax}
:::

| We give here two similar functions. The first one is for the Raweb, it
  is a reference to the English page, and the second is for Research
  Reports. In the URL, en is replaced by fr, and THEME is spelled as
  THÈME. The effect of this command is to insert, just above the logo,
  the value of the theme, with a rule on each side. The `\vfil` is for
  vertical centering of the title. The 8cm is obtained by trial and
  error. The `\firstchar` command is now useless. We show show here the
  two versions of the Logo: French and English. As you can see, they are
  not exactly the same.

:::

This puts the logo at the right place in case of a Inria Research or
Technical Report. Digits seem randomly chosen: you would expect both
logos to be of the same size, inserted at the origin, with a width of
210mm.

:::

This command is used to put the Raweb logo (depending on the year) and
the Inria logo on the front page. This code is awful: the text INRIA
etc. has a width of 128mm, and is at 39mm from one border and 43 from
the other one. The `\vfil` is for vertical alignment of the text that
follows (name of the team etc).

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\foinria{%
      \ra@atxy(7.8cm,2.5cm){\includegraphics[width=5.7cm]{Logo-INRIA-couleur}}%

      \null\vskip0.7cm \leavevmode\hskip-3.5cm\box0\null\vskip2cm\vfil}
:::

We invented `<cleardoublepage/>`. Its effect is to make the first page
of text appear on a right page (the text starts on a odd page; in fact
it starts on page one, because we use the adequate `<fo:page-sequence>`
element. Of course, the problem could be solved by putting the table of
contents at the end of the document.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \XMLelement{cleardoublepage}
     {} {\cleardoublepage} {}
:::

This is another element we have to add, because we do not know how to
express this in xslt-fo: We want a rule just below the page headings.
This produces a box of width zero, with a rule of the width of the page
that will be below the text that follows.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \XMLelement{pagestylehrule}
     {} {\hbox to0pt{\rule[-1ex]{\textwidth}{.03cm}\hss}} {}

### 5.9 Math and images

There is a PerlScript names extract-math.pl, that tries to convert
MathML into images. The document to be converted is
[here](raweb1.html#extract-math). This converts to 5 images: image
one=![mathimage 1](/img/math_image_1.png){.vc .vc}, image
two=![mathimage 2](/img/math_image_2.png){.vc .vc}, image
three=![mathimage 3](/img/math_image_3.png){.vc .vc}, image
four=![mathimage 4](/img/math_image_4.png){.vc .vc}, and image
five=![mathimage 5](/img/math_image_5.png){.vc .vc}.

The idea is to use some code from latex2html.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \XMLelement{formula}
     {\XMLattribute{id}{\XML@formid}{none}}
     {\@inlinemathA{\XML@formid}}
     {\@inlinemathZ}
:::

There is no need to redefine brackets, because in the current version,
nothing is in display. The argument of this procedure is the number of
the image (the \`id\' attribute of the XML element). We open a box,
containing a rule, and the content of the element.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \newbox\sizebox
    \def\@inlinemathA#1{%
      \gdef\[{$\displaystyle}\gdef\]{$} % hack...
      \xdef\@mathenv{#1}%
      \adjustnormalsize \newpage\clearpage
      \setbox\sizebox=\hbox\bgroup\kern.05em
      \vrule height1.5ex width0pt }
:::

This is a hack defined by latex2html. Is everything needed?

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \AtBeginDocument{
    \let\realnormalsize=\relax
    \def\adjustnormalsize{%
      \def\normalsize{\mathsurround=0pt \realnormalsize
       \parindent=0pt\abovedisplayskip=0pt\belowdisplayskip=0pt}%
      \def\phantompar{\csname par\endcsname}%
      \normalsize}
    }
:::

Vertical alignment is done as follows: the baseline is either the bottom
or the center. That is, if the depth of the box is not zero, we add a
vrule with the same height and depth.

::: {.container .ltx-source}
    \def\@centerinlinemath{%
      \dimen1=\ifdim\ht\sizebox<\dp\sizebox \dp\sizebox\else\ht\sizebox\fi
      \advance\dimen1by.5pt \vrule width0pt height\dimen1 depth\dimen1 
     \dp\sizebox=\dimen1\ht\sizebox=\dimen1\relax}
:::

This is done at the end of the math formula. The log file will contain
lines of the form *l2hSize :1:8.0pt::8.0pt::94.54239pt*. The Perl script
reads these data from the log file, and calls another Perl script:
/usr/bin/perl /usr/local/latex2html/bin/pstoimg -type png -tmp tmpdir
-discard -interlace -antialias -depth 1 -scale 1.4 -geometry 94x16
-margins 62,41 -crop abls -transparent -out math_image_1.png

          \else\expandafter\vss\fi
      \clearpage
    }
:::

Now, sixty lines of hack. Complete code [here](raweb3.html#hack-item).
Translation of `fo:list-item-label` calls `\savebox{\ItemBox}{#1}` just
before `\item[#1]`. This code is executed again here. I don\'t remember

### 5.10 The fotex.cfg file
