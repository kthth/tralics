Implementation of the LaTeX3 Bundle in Tralics
==============================================

Introduction
------------

This document explains the implementation of the LaTeX3 expl3.sty
package. This consists in an extension of the C++ code, a style file
(using normal latex syntax) and a big tex file (using latex3 syntax)
which is expl3-code.tex minus the C++ code.

A partial implementation is available in Tralics version 2.15.4.

The most evident feature of LaTeX3 is that command names contain
underscore and colon characters (no atsign) and are much more explicit.
For instance `\@ne` and `\thr@@` are LaTeX constants, with value one and
three; in LaTeX3, they are named `\c_one` and `\c_three`. instead of
`\@tempboxa` and `\@tempcnta` there will be `\l_tmpa_box` and
`\g_tmpa_int`; the first one should be used for local assignment, the
second one for global assignment. A variable of the form
`\l_module_foo_tl` is local, defined in the module "module", named "foo"
and contains a token list, while `\l__module_foo_tl` is a private
variable of that module. In the case of the kernel, the module part is
omitted from the name.

The two commands `\module_foo:nnn` and `\__module_foo:nnn` are macro
names, respectively public and private, defined in the module; they take
three arguments (there are three letters after the colon). The meaning
of these letters is the following

-   None. A command whose name ends with a colon takes no argument.
    Example: `\prg_do_nothing:` (corresponds to `\@empty`, is a command
    whose expansion is void, while `\scan_stop:` is the sames as
    `\relax`.
-   `n`: Unexpanded token or braced token list. Example `\use:nn`. This
    is a command that takes two arguments, whose expansion is formed of
    these arguments. For instance `\use:nn {a b}{{c d}}` expands to
    `a b{c d}` (one pair of braces disappears), while `\use:nn a b`
    expands to `ab` (an argument can be preceded by an optional space).
-   `N`: Single token (unlike `n`, the argument must not be surrounded
    by braces). Example `\cs_if_eq:NNTF` takes for arguments, compares
    the first two, and expands to the third if the test is true, to the
    fourth otherwise. The test is done by `\if_meaning:w` (aka `\ifx`)
    that compares two tokens. It is very complicated to grab a single
    token in TeX, so, generally, all that matters is that the arguments
    consists in a single token; so `\cs_if_eq:NNTF {a}{a} {ok}{\bad}`
    expands to ok. If the first argument is `{ab}`, LaTeX compares a and
    b, and the test is false; if the first argument is empty, you could
    be in trouble. An error is signaled in such cases by *Tralics*. On
    the other hand `\cs_gset_eq:NN` behaves like `\global\let`. So
    `\cs_set_eq:NN    {=}` tries to redefine the opening brace, which is
    an error (unless the opening brace is an active character, an
    unusual situation).
-   `T`, `F`: These are special cases of `n` arguments. Example:
    `\cs_if_eq:NNTF`, `\cs_if_eq:NNT`, `\cs_if_eq:NNF` and
    `\cs_if_eq_p:NN`, are four commands that process the first two
    arguments in the same way. The command that takes only two
    parameters expand to true or false (this will be explained later
    on), the first one (with four arguments) is explained aove; the
    other one take three argument; the expansion is this argument (if
    the truth value matches the extension) and is empty otherwise. So
    both `\cs_if_eq:NNT aa {ok}` and `\cs_if_eq:NNF ab {ok}` expand to
    `ok`. The letters T and F are only used in this case.
-   `p`: Primitive TeX parameter specification. This is used in command
    that define other commands whose arguments are not specified by a
    suffix. Example: `\cs_set_nopar:Npn` is `\def` and `\cs_set:Npn`
    behaves like `\long\def`.
-   `w`: This means that the argument syntaxis "weird" in that it does
    not follow any standard rule. Example `\if_meaning:w` cited above;
    this command reads two argument and compares them. It this executes
    the true or false code and skips the other one; this is the "weird"
    part of the syntax. LaTeX3 never defines commands with such a
    syntax: see T and F above.
-   `D`: This means **Do not use**. Example `\tex_ifx:D` and
    `\tex_let:D`; these are alternate names for `\ifx` and `\let`; the
    idea is to always use macros with a colon in their name in the
    package files. The first macro is also known as `\if_meaning:w`, and
    the second is like `\cs_set_eq:NN` (the difference is that you can
    say `\let\foo= 3` where the equals sign and the space that follows
    it are optional, and `\cs_set_eq:NN~ 3` makes the active character
    tilde behave like a space and typesets 3.
-   Variants. For instance `\cs_set_eq:cN {foo}\bar` is equivalent to
    `\exp_after:wN \cs_set_eq:cN \cs:w foo\cs_end:\bar` or, with TeX
    syntax: `\expandafter \let \csname   foo\endcsname= \bar`. In
    general a variant calls the base function (here `\cs_set_eq:NN`,
    unless optimiseed for speed.
-   `c` variant. As explained above, this means that the argument is
    processed by `\csname` (so is a command name). Example `\use:c` is
    the same as `\@nameuse` it reads a sequence of tokens, fully expands
    them, converts the resulting characters into a control sequence name
    (which is the result of the expansion). If the expansion contains
    `\par`, an error is signaled; note that `\@nameuse` signals an error
    is `\par` is part of the argument. The command `\cs_if_exist:cTF` is
    like `\cs_if_exist:NTF` but uses `\if_cs_exist:w` rather than
    `\if_cs_exist:N` (i.e., `\ifcsname` or `\ifdefined`); the idea is to
    avoid filling the hash table with an undefined token.
-   `x` variant. Fully-expanded token or braced token list. Example
    `\iow_log:x`, which is the same as `\wlog`; it prints its argument
    in the transcript file; the expansion is done by TeX. Other example
    `\cs_set_nopar:Npx` (aka `\edef`) is the base function for doing
    full expansion. Now `\use:x{foo}` is the same as
    `\edef\tmp{foo}\tmp`. For this reason, the command is not
    expandable, and x-type arguments cannot be nested. Note that
    `\str_if_eq_x:nnTF` is similar to `\str_if_eq:nnTF`. The idea here
    is that the pdftex function that compares two string fully expands
    them; and you have to use `\unexpanded` in order to avoid this
    expansion.
